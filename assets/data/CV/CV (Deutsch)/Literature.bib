  Abstract                 = {In an experiment investigating the impact of preweaning social experience on later social behavior in pigs, we were interested in the mutual spatial positions of pigs during paired social interactions. To obtain these data, we applied a different colored mark to the head and back of each of 2 pigs per group and videotaped the pigs' interactions. We used the EthoVision tracking system to provide x,y coordinates of the four colored marks every 0.2 sec. This paper describes the structure and functioning of a FoxPro program designed to clean the raw data and use it to identify the mutual body positions of the 2 animals at 0.2-sec intervals. Cleaning the data was achieved by identifying invalid data points and replacing them by interpolations. An algorithm was then applied to extract three variables from the coordinates: (1) whether the two pigs were in body contact; (2) the mutual orientation (parallel, antiparallel, or perpendicular) of the two pigs; and (3) whether the pig in the "active" position made snout contact in front of, or behind, the ear base of the other pig. Using these variables, we were able to identify five interaction types: Pig A attacks, Pig B attacks, undecided head-to-head position, "clinch" resting position, or no contact. To assess the reliability of the automatic system, a randomly chosen 5-min videotaped interaction was scored for mutual positions both visually (by 2 independent observers) and automatically. Good agreement was found between the data from the 2 observers and between each observer's data and the data from the automated system, as assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a simple traffic model with a non-signalized road intersection. In this model the car arriving from the right has precedence. The vehicle dynamics far from the crossing are governed by the rules introduced by Nagel and Paczuski, which define how drivers behave when braking or accelerating. We measure the average velocity of the ensemble of cars and its flow as a function of the density of cars on the roadway. An additional set of rules is defined to describe the dynamics at the intersection assuming a fraction of drivers that do not obey the rule of precedence. This problem is treated within a game-theory framework, where the drivers that obey the rule are cooperators and those who ignore it are defectors. We study the consequences of these behaviors as a function of the fraction of cooperators and defectors. The results show that cooperation is the best strategy because it maximizes the flow of vehicles and minimizes the number of accidents. A rather paradoxical effect is observed: for any percentage of defectors the number of accidents is larger when the density of cars is low because of the higher average velocity.},

In the past, these data were measured by a 3D motion analysis system consisting of high-speed cameras and force plates, which must be installed in the floor. However, a conventional 3D motion analysis system can measure the ground reaction force and the center of pressure just on force plates during a few steps. In addition, the subjects' stride lengths are limited because they have to walk on the center of the force plate. These problems can be resolved by converting conventional devices into wearable devices. We used a measuring device consisting of portable force plates and motion sensors. We developed a walking analysis system that calculates the ground reaction force, the center of pressure, and the body orientations and measured a walking subject to estimate this system. We simultaneously used a conventional 3D motion analysis system to compare with our development system and showed its validity for measurements of ground reaction force and the center of pressure.},

In fact, research on canonical and mirror neurons has shown that an as if simulative schema is required to perceive, categorize and understand the meaning of the external world. The present study compares the cognitive paradigm of embodied cognition with Pierre Bourdieu's practice theory. Specifically, cognitive processes and cultural mechanisms are described as phenomena that emerge from the dynamic interaction that exists between people's practical abilities and the structure of the local environment in which they act and live. A pragmatic conception of knowledge has also emerged in the field of ethnological investigation. Indeed, the concepts of resonance and empathy have proven to be essential instruments for ethnological knowledge.},

It was expected that subjects with far interpersonal distance preferences would experience greater stress-related arousal in a crowded environment than subjects preferring closer interpersonal distances and consequently would display more physiological, behavioral, and subjective indications of discomfort. During the crowding experience, subjects preferring far interpersonal distances were found to be most physiologically stressed (as measured by electrodermal responses) and later reported having experienced greater somatic stress. Crowded subjects had higher skin conductance levels during exposure, thereafter reported greater discomfort due to restricted space, and manifested lower performance levels on creativity tasks administered immediately following crowding.

  Abstract                 = {The primate visual motion system performs numerous functions essential for survival in a dynamic visual world. Prominent among these functions is the ability to recover and represent the trajectories of objects in a form that facilitates behavioral responses to those movements. The first step toward this goal, which consists of detecting the displacement of retinal image features, has been studied for many years in both psychophysical and neurobiological experiments. Evidence indicates that achievement of this step is computationally straightforward and occurs at the earliest cortical stage. The second step involves the selective integration of retinal motion signals according to the object of origin. Realization of this step is computationally demanding, as the solution is formally underconstrained. It must rely--by definition--upon utilization of retinal cues that are indicative of the spatial relationships within and between objects in the visual scene. Psychophysical experiments have documented this dependence and suggested mechanisms by which it may be achieved.

Stride length, duty factor (the fraction of the stride, for which the foot is on the ground) and the pattern of force on the ground are varied, and the optimum gait is deemed to be the one that minimizes the positive work that the muscles must perform, per unit distance travelled. Even the simplest model, whose legs have neither mass nor elastic compliance, predicts the changes of duty factor and force pattern that people make as they increase their speed of walking. It predicts a sudden change to running at a critical speed, but this is much faster than the speed at which people make the change. When elastic compliance is incorporated in the model, unnaturally fast walking becomes uncompetitive. However, a slow run with very brief foot contact becomes the optimum gait at low speeds, at which people would walk, unless severe energy dissipation occurs in the compliance. A model whose legs have mass as well as elastic compliance predicts well the relationship between speed and stride length in human walking.},

  Abstract                 = {Crowd safety is a major concern for those attending and managing mass gatherings, such as the annual Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca (also called Makkah). One threat to crowd safety at such events is crowd density. However, recent research also suggests that psychological membership of crowds can have positive benefits. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of density on safety might vary depending on whether there is shared social identification in the crowd. We surveyed 1,194 pilgrims at the Holy Mosque, Mecca, during the 2012 Hajj. Analysis of the data showed that the negative effect of crowd density on reported safety was moderated by social identification with the crowd. Whereas low identifiers reported reduced safety with greater crowd density, high identifiers reported increased safety with greater crowd density. Mediation analysis suggested that a reason for these moderation effects was the perception that other crowd members were supportive. Differences in reported safety across national groups (Arab countries and Iran compared with the rest) were also explicable in terms of crowd identification and perceived support. These findings support a social identity account of crowd behavior and offer a novel perspective on crowd safety management.},

We investigate the model checking of sequential hierarchical (nested) systems, i.e., finite-state machines whose states themselves can be other machines. This nesting ability is common in various software design methodologies, and is available in several commercial modeling tools. The straightforward way to analyze a hierarchical machine is to flatten it (thus incurring an exponential blow up) and apply a model-checking tool on the resulting ordinary FSM. We show that this flattening can be avoided. We develop algorithms for verifying linear-time requirements whose complexity is polynomial in the size of the hierarchical machine. We also address the verification of branching time requirements and provide efficient algorithms and matching lower bounds.},

  abstract  = {During the last years a new approach to construct safe block and stream ciphers has been developed using the theory of dynamical systems. Since a block cryptosystem is generally, from the mathematical point of view, a family (parametrized by the keys) of permutations of n-bit numbers, one of the main problems of this approach is to adapt the dynamics defined by a map f to the block structure of the cryptosystem. In this paper we propose a method based on the approximation of f by periodic maps Tn (v.g. some interval exchange transformations). The approximation of automorphisms of measure spaces by periodic automorphisms was introduced by Halmos and Rohlin. One important aspect studied in our paper is the relation between the dynamical properties of the map f (say, ergodicity or mixing) and the immunity of the resulting cipher to cryptolinear attacks, which is currently one of the standard benchmarks for cryptosystems to be considered secure. Linear cryptanalysis, first proposed by M. Matsui, exploits some statistical inhomogeneities of expressions called linear approximations for a given cipher. Our paper quantifies immunity to cryptolinear attacks in terms of the approximation speed of the map f by the periodic Tn. We show that the most resistant block ciphers are expected when the approximated dynamical system is mixing.},

accu:rate investigates the influence of parameters such as the average velocity or torso size or strength obstacle potential on evacuation times in a number of bottlenck scenarios. 
The goal is to filter out parameters with little influence. The tool OptiSLang is used.

For this, a linear and a quadratic regression model are hypothesised for the parameters of interest as independent variables and with the evacuation time as the dependent variable. R-values and other statistical paramters are given. Curiously, p-values are not given.

The velocity is dignosed as the parameter with the highest influence among the ones considered in this scenario.

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models are used to simulate, and sometimes control, the behavior of physical and artificial processes such as the weather and very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits. The increasing need for accuracy has led to the development of highly complex models. However, in the presence of limited computational accuracy and storage capabilities model reduction (system approximation) is often necessary. Approximation of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems provides a comprehensive picture of model reduction, combining system theory with numerical linear algebra and computational considerations. It addresses the issue of model reduction and the resulting trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Special attention is given to numerical aspects, simulation questions, and practical applications.},

We investigate this model analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions. At a critical value of the particle density a transition occurs from a phase with 'free flow' to one with 'jammed flow'. We are able to analytically predict the current-density diagram for the infinite system and to find the scaling function that describes the finite size rounding at the transition point.},

Hard-core particles hop in a single direction on a discrete lattice and are updated in a fixed order, determined by a phase attached to each particle. The bulk dynamics is completely deterministic. While the case of periodic boundary conditions was studied in a companion paper, we consider here open boundaries through which particles enter and exit at random times. The full phase diagram is predicted analytically and exhibits a transition between a free flow phase and a jammed phase. The density profile is predicted within the framework of a domain wall theory and compared to Monte Carlo simulations, in particular in the vicinity of the transition. We discuss the relevance of the algorithm for real pedestrian traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by interest in pedestrian traffic we study two lanes (one-dimensional lattices) of length L that intersect at a single site. Each lane is modeled by a deterministic TASEP (totally asymmetric exclusion process). The particles enter and leave lane \sigma (where \sigma = 1, 2) with probabilities \alpha \sigma and \beta \sigma , respectively. We employ the 'frozen shuffle' update introduced in earlier work (Appert-Rolland et al 2011 J. Stat. Mech. P07009), in which the particle positions are updated in a fixed random order. We find analytically that each lane may be in a 'free flow' or in a 'jammed' state. Hence the phase diagram in the domain 0 \leq \alpha 1, \alpha 2 \leq 1 consists of four regions with boundaries depending on \beta 1 and \beta 2 . The regions meet in a single point on the diagonal of the domain. Our analytical predictions for the phase boundaries as well as for the currents and densities in each phase are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.},

In the frame of the PEDIGREE project, trajectories of pedestrians walking along a one-dimensional path were tracked through a high-precision motion capture. Data analysis allowed to obtain the fundamental diagram at different scales. Two unexpected transitions in the way pedestrians follow each other have been evidenced. The interest of the experiment is to capture at the same time microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of the flow. Indeed, macroscopic structures such as stop-and-go waves can also be studied from the data. Eventually, a data-based following model has been proposed. Its calibration/validation can be performed both at the microscopic or macroscopic level. It is possible to extend the model to quasi-one-dimensional flows for the modeling of pedestrian flows in corridors.},

Here we consider two discrete-time versions of the EQP with parallel and backward-sequential update rules. The phase diagram (with respect to the arrival probability alpha and the service probability beta ) is divided into two phases corresponding to divergence and convergence of the system length. We investigate the behavior on the critical line separating these phases. For both update rules, we find diffusive behavior for small service probability (beta < beta_c). . However, for beta > beta_c it becomes sub-diffusive and nonuniversal: the critical exponents characterizing the divergence of the system length and the number of customers are found to depend on the update rule. For the backward-update case, they also depend on the hopping parameter p , and remain finite when p is large, indicating a first-order transition.},

Stat. Phys. 141, 829 (2010)]. In this paper, we analyze the dynamical properties of the number of particles Nt and the position of the last particle (the system length) Lt, using an analytical method (generating function technique) as well as a phenomenological description based on domain-wall dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The system exhibits two phases corresponding to linear convergence or divergence of Nt and Lt. These phases can both further be subdivided into high-density and maximal-current subphases. The predictions of the domain-wall theory are found to be in very good agreement quantitively with results from Monte Carlo simulations in the convergent phase. On the other hand, in the divergent phase, only the prediction for Nt agrees with simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Cockroaches were observed with videographic methods as escape running was initiated, but with obstacles in the path of their run. The goal was to determine the repertoire of possible responses to obstacles and the sensory cues used to trigger the responses. Intact cockroaches collided with obstacles on only about 10% of trials. The most common collision avoidance strategy was simply to stop running prior to impact. However, occasionally animals moved vertically and climbed over the barrier, or turned and navigated an edge of the obstacle, or completely reversed run direction. The avoidance strategies chosen depended on the size and configuration of the obstacle. Tests for the use of vision in detecting obstacles showed that its role, if any, is small. However, all manipulations that altered the antennal system changed behavior in a way consistent with the hypothesis that antennal mechanosensation plays a major role in collision avoidance. For example, reducing antennal length, or severing the main antennal nerve without altering the length produced significant increases in the frequency of collisions. Tests with tethered insects showed that (1) the antennae are preferentially directed forward as animals run, and (2) nearly simultaneous contact with both antennae is required to make the cockroach stop. Our data indicate that running cockroaches employ strategies that set their sensorimotor systems in a mode of readiness to deal with obstacles and they suggest that sensory information about the presence and configuration of obstacles is used to make choices, at very short latencies, about how to respond to obstructions.},

However, the mechanisms by which visual information is first learned and then used to control a route direction are not well understood. In this article, we propose a parsimonious mechanism for visually guided route following. We investigate whether a simple approach, involving scanning the environment and moving in the direction that appears most familiar, can provide a model of visually guided route learning in ants. We implement view familiarity as a means of navigation by training a classifier to determine whether a given view is part of a route and using the confidence in this classification as a proxy for familiarity. Through the coupling of movement and viewing direction, a familiar view specifies a familiar direction of viewing and thus a familiar movement to make. We show the feasibility of our approach as a model of ant-like route acquisition by learning a series of nontrivial routes through an indoor environment using a large gantry robot equipped with a panoramic camera.},

  Abstract                 = {The interest in insect navigation from diverse disciplines such as psychology and engineering is to a large extent because performance is achieved with such limited brain power. Desert ants are particularly impressive navigators, able to rapidly learn long, visually guided foraging routes. Their elegant behaviours provide inspiration to biomimetic engineers and for psychologists demonstrate the minimal mechanistic requirements for complex spatial behaviours. In this spirit, we have developed a parsimonious model of route navigation that captures many of the known properties of ants routes. Our model uses a neural network trained with the visual scenes experienced along a route to assess the familiarity of any view. Subsequent route navigation involves a simple behavioural routine, in which the simulated ant scans the world and moves in the most familiar direction, as determined by the network. The algorithm exhibits both place-search and route navigation using the same mechanism. Crucially, in our model it is not necessary to specify when or what to learn, nor separate routes into sequences of waypoints; thereby providing proof of concept that route navigation can be achieved without these elements. As such, we believe it represents the only detailed and complete model of insect route guidance to date.},

  abstract = {A lot of the data faced in science and engineering is not as complicated as it seems. There is the possibility of finding low dimensional descriptions of this usually high dimensional data. One of the ways of achieving this is with the use of diffusion maps. Diffusion maps represent the dataset by a weighted graph in which points correspond to vertices and edges are weighted. The spectral properties of the graph Laplacian are then used to map the high dimensional data into a lower dimensional representation. The algorithm is introduced on simple test examples for which the low dimensional description is known. Justification of the algorithm is given by showing its equivalence to a suitable minimisation problem and to random walks on graphs. The description of random walks in terms of partial differential equations is discussed. The heat equation for a probability density function is derived and used to further analyse the algorithm. Applications of diffusion maps are presented at the end of this dissertation. The First application is clustering of data (i.e. partitioning of a data set into subsets so that the data points in each subset have similar characteristics). An approach based on diffusion maps (spectral clustering) is compared to the K-means clustering algorithm. We then discuss techniques for colour image quantization (reduction of distinct colours in an image). Finally, the diffusion maps are used to discover low dimensional description of high dimensional sets of images.},

However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian simulation models based on Cellular Automata are viable alternatives to particle based approaches, employing a continuous spatial representation. The effects of discretisation, however, also imply some difficulties in modelling phenomena observed in reality. This paper focuses on the possibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated population of pedestrians by modifying an existing model extending the floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or cars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per time step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but we model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some turns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired walking speeds and a stochastic mechanism is defined to ensure that they maintain an average speed close to the desired one. The paper formally describes the model and the results of its application in benchmark scenarios. Finally, the paper shows how this approach can also support the definition of slopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians climbing them in a simulated scenario.},
  comment  = {<note author="gk">
Handles different speeds in a cellular automaton, I think, by letting fast agents hop more often. Not aware of our old publications on the same subject. Introduces a stairs model that uses a reduced speed instead of using the natural advantage of the cells to do somthing that resembles true climbing of stairs as in the OSM.

  abstract = {Abstract Studies related to crowds of pedestrians, both those of theoretical nature and application oriented ones, have generally focused on either the analysis or the synthesis of the phenomena related to the interplay between individual pedestrians, each characterised by goals, preferences and potentially relevant relationships with others, and the environment in which they are situated. The cases in which these activities have been systematically integrated for a mutual benefit are still very few compared to the corpus of crowd related literature. This paper presents a case study of an integrated approach to the definition of an innovative model for pedestrian and crowd simulation (on the side of synthesis) that was actually motivated and supported by the analyses of empirical data acquired from both experimental settings and observations in real world scenarios. In particular, we will introduce a model for the adaptive behaviour of pedestrians that are also members of groups, that strive to maintain their cohesion even in difficult (e.g., high density) situations. The paper will show how the synthesis phase also provided inputs to the analysis of empirical data, in a virtuous circle.},

While these situations can be relatively infrequent, and even if architects, event organisers and crowd managers actually try to prevent them as much as possible, they simply cannot be neglected and they actually represent interesting situations to be analysed by means of simulation. The paper presents specific extensions to a floor-field Cellular Automata pedestrian model that are specifically aimed at supporting the simulation of high density situations comprising negative interactions among pedestrians without incurring in the traditional limits of discrete approaches.

Building on previous work, this proposal posits that rudimentary information is extracted rapidly from the input to derive analogies linking that input with representations in memory. The linked stored representations then activate the associations that are relevant in the specific context, which provides focused predictions. These predictions facilitate perception and cognition by pre-sensitizing relevant representations. Predictions regarding complex information, such as those required in social interactions, integrate multiple analo- gies. This cognitive neuroscience framework can help explain a variety of phenomena, ranging from recognition to first impressions, and from the brain's default mode to a host of mental disorders.},
  comment  = {<note author=gk> Accpording to Wael El Deredy one of the groundwork laying articles on decision making. From a psychologist's view. Proposition: Human brain is constantly generating predictions to approximate the relevant future using gist information and drawing on analogies from existing representations in the brain. What is new? Integretion of the well studied concepts of associations, analogies, predictions in one framework. Proposition of proactivness of the brain. Emphasis on the role of representations in memory in the decision process. What is important for us? The framework is a nice model if we choose to believe it. The claim that only gist information is used, could justify our simple and rough models of the reality that our peds can perceive. if they use gist infor only,. we don't need to model details. The question of what is the vital gist info, of course, remains open. Propostion that the reliance on gist info of the brain may put people "on the wrong path". This would mean that there are a number of erroneous decisions that seem "irrational". Difficult: How do we get representations in memory? How are the propositions proved? Framework: not tested directly. Test possiblilities ar proposed in the outlook: If one inclreases the number of available analogies in the memory the predictions should become better. Gist info as basis of analogies and hence predictions: Says this is known for recognition. Done by screening the brain for activity. Unclear for higher level abstraction. </note>},

The authors propose that modularity, cleanly defined, provides a useful framework for directing research and resolving debates about individual cognitive systems and the nature of human evolved cognition. Modularity is a fundamental property of living things at every level of organization; it might prove indispensable for understanding the structure of the mind as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Interventions of central, top-down planning are serious limitations to the possibility of modelling the dynamics of cities. An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the 'Haussmann period'. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789-2010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.},

  Abstract                 = {When walking over complex terrain, humans use visual information about the upcoming ground surface layout to exploit the passive physical forces inherent to bipedal locomotion. We previously showed that visual information about potential target footholds for an upcoming step is critical for control during the end of the preceding step. Visual information about target position presented during this critical control phase was sufficient for subjects to accurately step to a target, while the same information presented before or after the critical phase resulted in less accurate foot placement. Although visual information about target position is not essential once the step to that target is initiated, it remains unclear whether humans are capable of using such information to improve stepping accuracy following a perturbation during that step. Reynolds and Day (2005) demonstrated that, when taking a single step, participants rapidly respond to changes in target position while the foot is in flight. However, it is not known whether humans exhibit such active corrections during continuous walking over longer stretches of complex terrain, when locomotion is largely under passive control. In the present study, subjects walked along a path of irregularly spaced targets projected onto the ground while their movements were recorded with motion capture. As subjects approached targets, each target briefly disappeared and then reappeared. On a subset of trials, the location of one of the six targets was perturbed in either a medial-lateral or anterior-posterior direction while invisible. Subjects' responses to the perturbation depended on the timing of visual information during that step. Discussion focuses on the contributions of active control, to respond to perturbations during the swing phase, and passive control, to efficiently adapt the gait cycle to upcoming terrain.},

  Abstract                 = {In clinical trials with an active control usually therapeutical equivalence of a new treatment is investigated by looking at a location parameter of the distributions of the primary efficacy variable. But even if the location parameters are close to each other existing differences in variability may be connected with different risks for under or over treatment in an individual patient.Assuming normally distributed responses a multiple test procedure applying two shifted one-sided t-tests for the mean and accordingly two one-sided F-tests for the variances is proposed. Equivalence in location and variability is established if all four tests lead to a rejection at the (one-sided) level alpha. A conservative procedure "correcting" the t-tests for heteroscedasticity is derived. The choice of a design in terms of the global level alpha, the global power, the relevant deviations in the population means and variances, as well as the sample size is outlined. Numerical calculations of the actual level and power for the proposed designs show, that for balanced sample sizes the classical uncorrected one-sided t-tests can be used safely without exaggerating the global type I error probability.Finally an example is given.},

  Abstract                 = {This article surveys a general approach to error control and adaptive mesh design in Galerkin finite element methods that is based on duality principles as used in optimal control. Most of the existing work on a posteriori error analysis deals with error estimation in global norms like the energy norm or the L2 norm, involving usually unknown stability constants. However, in most applications, the error in a global norm does not provide useful bounds for the errors in the quantities of real physical interest. Further, their sensitivity to local error sources is not properly represented by global stability constants. These deficiencies are overcome by employing duality techniques, as is common in a priori error analysis of finite element methods, and replacing the global stability constants by computationally obtained local sensitivity factors. Combining this with Galerkin orthogonality, a posteriori estimates can be derived directly for the error in the target quantity. In these estimates local residuals of the computed solution are multiplied by weights which measure the dependence of the error on the local residuals. Those, in turn, can be controlled by locally refining or coarsening the computational mesh. The weights are obtained by approximately solving a linear adjoint problem. The resulting a posteriori error estimates provide the basis of a feedback process for successively constructing economical meshes and corresponding error bounds tailored to the particular goal of the computation. This approach, called the dual-weighted-residual method, is introduced initially within an abstract functional analytic setting, and is then developed in detail for several model situations featuring the characteristic properties of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems. After having discussed the basic properties of duality-based adaptivity, we demonstrate the potential of this approach by presenting a selection of results obtained for practical test cases. These include problems from viscous fluid flow, chemically reactive flow, elasto-plasticity, radiative transfer, and optimal control. Throughout the paper, open theoretical and practical problems are stated together with references to the relevant literature.},

State of the art from 2012, from a purely differential equation perspective: social forces for microscopic models and fluid dynamics for macroscopic models.
CA or agent-models or network flow models have completely escaped the authors' notice as mathematical models.
The authors add a probability distribution to both approaches of which I have not understood the use.
Then a model is presented that considers peds as particles with activity states that are randomly distributed to model different walking ability. This follows ideas from kinetic theory.

What I liked:
The search for and understanding of appropriate mathematical structures to model crowd dynamics is seen as a task in itself. Empirical information is seen as the source of inspiration to find such mathematical structures beyond being a means to calibrate and validate.
Calibration and validation are seen as we do it in our group.
"Models have to produce, at least at a qualitative level, emerging phenomena which are observed in real situations, including the sensitivity to environmental conditions".
"Upscaling microscopic information to the macroscopic level without relying one purely phenomenological guesses" is recognized as a crucial problem

Criticisms:
The kinetic model is not intuitive. Validation of it is not discussed in this paper.
The authors use panic in a sense that modern psychology would reject, especially making claims on how panicky agents act that are not based on empirical findings from psychology.

It can be observed in many animals, such as bird flocks, shoals or herds of ungulates. Spatial attraction between humans as the central component of flocking behaviour has been simulated in a number of seminal models but it has not been detected experimentally in human groups so far. The two other sub-processes of this self-organised collective movement -- collision avoidance and alignment -- are excluded or held constant respectively in this study. We created a computer-based, multi-agent game where human players, represented as black dots, moved on a virtual playground. The participants were deprived of social cues about each other and could neither communicate verbally nor nonverbally. They played two games: (1) Single Game, where other players were invisible, and (2) Joint Game, where each player could see players' positions in a local radius around himself/herself. We found that individuals approached their neighbours spontaneously if their positions were visible, leading to less spatial dispersion of the whole group compared to moving alone. We conclude that human groups show the basic component of flocking behaviour without being explicitly instructed or rewarded to do so.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a formal approach to reciprocal n-body collision avoidance, where multiple mobile robots need to avoid collisions with each other while moving in a common workspace. In our formulation, each robot acts fully independently, and does not communicate with other robots. Based on the definition of velocity obstacles [5], we derive sufficient conditions for collision-free motion by reducing the problem to solving a low-dimensional linear program. We test our approach on several dense and complex simulation scenarios involving thousands of robots and compute collision-free actions for all of them in only a few milliseconds. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first that can guarantee local collision-free motion for a large number of robots in a cluttered workspace.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a nonparametric modeling approach for forecasting stochastic dynamical systems on low-dimensional manifolds. The key idea is to represent the discrete shift maps on a smooth basis which can be obtained by the diffusion maps algorithm. In the limit of large data, this approach converges to a Galerkin projection of the semigroup solution to the underlying dynamics on a basis adapted to the invariant measure. This approach allows one to quantify uncertainties (in fact, evolve the probability distribution) for nontrivial dynamical systems with equation-free modeling. We verify our approach on various examples, ranging from an inhomogeneous anisotropic stochastic differential equation on a torus, the chaotic Lorenz three-dimensional model, and the Nino-3.4 data set which is used as a proxy of the El Nino Southern Oscillation.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand them scientifically and manage them in practice has remained limited. The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable interest among engineers and scientists, bi-directional interaction between walking pedestrians and lively bridges has still not been well understood. In an attempt to bridge this gap a biomechanically inspired model of the human response to lateral bridge motion is presented and explored. The simple inverted pendulum model captures the key features of pedestrian lateral balance and the resulting forces on the structure. The forces include self-excited components that can be effectively modelled as frequency-dependent added damping and mass to the structure. The results of numerical simulations are in reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements of humans walking on a laterally oscillating treadmill, and in very good agreement with measurements on full-scale bridges. In contrast to many other models of lateral pedestrian loading, synchronisation with the bridge motion is not involved. A parametric study of the model is conducted, revealing that as pedestrians slow down as a crowd becomes more dense, their resulting lower pacing rates generate larger self-excited forces. For typical pedestrian parameters, the potential to generate negative damping arises for any lateral bridge vibration frequency above 0.43 Hz, depending on the walking frequency. Stability boundaries of the combined pedestrian-structure system are presented in terms of the structural damping ratio and pedestrian-to-bridge mass ratio, revealing complex relations between damping demand and bridge and pedestrian frequencies, due to the added mass effect. Finally it is demonstrated that the model can produce simultaneous self-excited forces on multiple structural modes, and a realistic full simulation of a large number of pedestrians, walking randomly and interacting with a bridge, produces structural behaviour in very good agreement with site observations.},

  abstract = {The collective behaviour of human crowds emerges from the local interactions of individuals. To understand human crowds we therefore need to identify the behavioural rules individual pedestrians follow. This is crucial for the control of emergency evacuations from confined spaces, for example. At a microscopic level we seek to predict the next step of pedestrians based on their local environment. However, we also have to consider 'tactical-level' individual behaviour that is not an immediate response to the local environment, such as the choice between different routes to exit a building. We used an interactive virtual environment to study human exit route decisions in simulated evacuations. Participants had to escape from a building and had to choose between different exit routes in the presence of evacuating simulated agents. We found no inherent preference for familiar routes, but under a stress-inducing treatment, subjects were more likely to display behaviour in their route choice that was detrimental to their evacuation time. Most strikingly, subjects were less likely to avoid a congested exit by changing their original decision to move towards it under this treatment. Age and gender had clear effects on reaction times in the virtual environment.},

Models have been highly influential in highlighting how collective motion can be produced from purely local interactions between individuals. Typical models in this field are termed {\textquoteleft}metric{\textquoteright} because each individual only reacts to conspecifics within a fixed distance. A recent large-scale study has, however, provided evidence that interactions ruling collective behaviour occur between a fixed number of nearest neighbours ({\textquoteleft}topological{\textquoteright} framework). Despite their importance in clarifying the nature of the mechanism underlying animal interactions, these findings have yet to be produced by either metric or topological models. Here, we present an original individual-based model of collective animal motion that reproduces the previous findings. Our approach bridges the current gap between previous model analysis and recent evidence, and presents a framework for further study.},

In particular, to make evacuations safer, we need to understand how individuals make movement decisions in crowds. Here, we present an evacuation experiment with over 500 participants testing individual behaviour in an interactive virtual environment. Participants had to choose between different exit routes under the influence of three different types of directional information: static information (signs), dynamic information (movement of simulated crowd) and memorized information, as well as the combined effect of these different sources of directional information. In contrast to signs, crowd movement and memorized information did not have a significant effect on human exit route choice in isolation. However, when we combined the latter two treatments with additional directly conflicting sources of directional information, for example signs, they showed a clear effect by reducing the number of participants that followed the opposing directional information. This suggests that the signals participants observe more closely in isolation do not simply overrule alternative sources of directional information. Age and gender did not consistently explain differences in behaviour in our experiments.},

  abstract = {Many group-living animals show social preferences for relatives, familiar conspecifics or individuals of similar attributes such as size, personality or sex. How such preferences could affect the collective motion of animal groups has been rather unexplored. We present a general model of collective animal motion that includes social connections as preferential reactions between individuals. Our conceptual examples illustrate the possible impact of underlying social networks on the collective motion of animals. Our approach shows that the structure of these networks could influence: (1) the cohesion of groups; (2) the spatial position of individuals within groups; and (3) the hierarchical dynamics within such groups. We argue that the position of individuals within a social network and the social network structure of populations could have important fitness implications for individual animals. Counterintuitive results from our conceptual examples show that social structures can result in unexpected group dynamics. This sharpens our understanding of the way in which collective movement can be interpreted as a result of social interactions.},

  abstract = {In Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), the mobility of the network users can heavily affect the performance of networking protocols because it causes sudden connectivity changes and topological variations. This is even more important in recent promising paradigms proposed in this field, such as opportunistic and delay tolerant networks. For this reason, it is important to understand the characteristics of the user movements in order to properly handle mobility when designing networking protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. In addition, it is highly desirable to have a mobility model that accurately reproduces the user mobility, thus enabling researchers to evaluate, either analytically or by means of simulations, their protocols under realistic mobility conditions. Recently, there have been many studies aimed to uncover the nature of human movements. In this paper, based on recent literature, we identify three main properties that are fundamental to characterize human mobility. Then, we propose a mobility model (HCMM) that integrates all these three features. To the best of our knowledge, the model proposed is the first one that combines notions about the sociality of users with spatial properties observed in real users movement patterns, i.e., their preference to spend time in a limited number of popular locations and to preferentially select short distances over longer ones. We study the \{HCMM\} both through simulation and analysis. Based on this study, we highlight some of its important temporal and spatial features, and we show that they are correctly reproduced in terms of key indicators such as jump size and inter-contact time distribution.},

  abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated "reverse engineering" approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.},

We consider a set of agents interacting with dynamics given by the Cucker-Smale model, and study its consensus stabilization via centralized and decentralized control configurations. We present a characterization of consensus emergence for systems with a feedback based on spatially confined information, corresponding to a parameter-dependent transition regime between self-regulation and centralized feedback stabilization.},

Our approach uses a weighted least squares definition of interpolation, based on a set of test vectors that are computed by a bootstrap setup cycle and then improved by a multigrid eigensolver and a local residual-based adaptive relaxation process. To emphasize the robustness, efficiency, and flexibility of the individual components of the proposed approach, we include extensive numerical results of the method applied to scalar elliptic partial differential equations discretized on structured meshes. As a first test problem, we consider the Laplace equation discretized on a uniform quadrilateral mesh, a problem for which multigrid is well understood. Then, we consider various more challenging variable coefficient systems coming from covariant finite-difference approximations of the two-dimensional gauge Laplacian system, a commonly used model problem in AMG algorithm development for linear systems arising in lattice field theory computations.},

  abstract = {The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process in discrete time is considered on finite rings with fixed number of particles. A translation-invariant version of the backward-ordered sequential update is defined for periodic boundary conditions. We prove that the so defined update leads to a stationary state in which all possible particle configurations have equal probabilities. Using the exact analytical expression for the propagator, we find the generating function for the conditional probabilities, average velocity and diffusion constant at all stages of evolution. An exact and explicit expression for the stationary velocity of \{TASEP\} on rings of arbitrary size and particle filling is derived. The evolution of small systems towards a steady state is clearly demonstrated. Considering the generating function as a partition function of a thermodynamic system, we study its zeros in planes of complex fugacities. At long enough times, the patterns of zeroes for rings with increasing size provide evidence for a transition of the associated two-dimensional lattice paths model into a clustered phase at low fugacities.},

Our first result is a determinant expression for the conditional probability of finding the particles at given initial and final positions, provided that they start and finish simultaneously. The expression has the same form as the one obtained by Sch\"{u}tz J. Stat. Phys. 88 427 (1997) for the continuous-time process. Next we prove that under some sufficient conditions the determinant expression can be generalized to the case when the particles start and finish at their own times.

When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate---everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments.},

  abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincar\'{e}s geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent models from theoretical physics have predicted that mass-migrating animal groups may share group-level properties, irrespective of the type of animals in the group. One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a survey of the fundamentals and the applications of sparse grids, with a focus on the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The sparse grid approach, introduced in Zenger (1991), is based on a higher-dimensional multiscale basis, which is derived from a one-dimensional multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction. Discretizations on sparse grids involve $O(N \cdot (\log N)^{d-1})$ degrees of freedom only, where $d$ denotes the underlying problem's dimensionality and where $N$ is the number of grid points in one coordinate direction at the boundary. The accuracy obtained with piecewise linear basis functions, for example, is $O(N^{-2} \cdot (\log N)^{d-1})$ with respect to the $L_{2^-}$ and $L_{\infty}$-norm, if the solution has bounded second mixed derivatives. This way, the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the exponential dependence $O(N^d)$ of conventional approaches, is overcome to some extent. For the energy norm, only $O(N)$ degrees of freedom are needed to give an accuracy of $O(N^{-1})$. That is why sparse grids are especially well-suited for problems of very high dimensionality. The sparse grid approach can be extended to nonsmooth solutions by adaptive refinement methods. Furthermore, it can be generalized from piecewise linear to higher-order polynomials. Also, more sophisticated basis functions like interpolets, prewavelets, or wavelets can be used in a straightforward way. We describe the basic features of sparse grids and report the results of various numerical experiments for the solution of elliptic PDEs as well as for other selected problems such as numerical quadrature and data mining.},

  abstract = {The design and dimensioning of escape routes in grandstands influence significantly the whole evacuation process of a football stadium. To analyzepedestrian traffic on grandstands, experiments under laboratory conditions with up to 300 participants have been performed in the ESPRIT arena in Duesseldorf. Fieldstudies in the same stadium and the BORUSSIA-PARK in Moenchengladbach complement the experimental database. In the first partof the dissertation an extensive literature review of pedestrian dynamics on stairs is presented. Precise trajectories, extracted from own experiments, are used to derive the fundamental diagram. The spatial dependency of the basic quantities velocity, density and specific flow on stairs is analyzed. Various influences on the flow and density in the mouth - standing and seated terraces, different slope of the grandstand, positioning of security personnel - are quantified in the second part of the thesis. Based on this data and gained insights the last chapter deals with the validation of a computersimulation. It is clarified, which aspects have to be considered for the validation of a spatial-continuous model. The comparison of the simulation results with experimental data allows conclusions about the correct approximation of reality.},

  abstract = {Abstract This contribution summarizes information about the fundamental diagram of stairs. First discrepancies of fundamental diagrams of well-known planning handbooks for pedestrian facilities and evacuation routes are discussed. To proof the correspondence to experimental data, published measurements available in literature are collected and compared. In the second part we derive a fundamental diagram for stairs downwards based on precise trajectories. In addition we scrutinize the influence of the slope of stair on the fundamental diagram. To check whether our experiments performed under laboratory conditions are comparable with characteristics of motion of every day situations, we present a comparison with a field study carried out at the same external staircase. Furthermore the contribution shows a method to gain topographical information of density, velocity, and specific flow structures to get a microscopic insight into pedestrian dynamics on stairs. This information could be used to identify effective bottlenecks.},

  abstract = {We propose a two-dimensional cellular automaton model to simulate pedestrian traffic. It is a vmax=1 model with exclusion statistics and parallel dynamics. Long-range interactions between the pedestrians are mediated by a so-called floor field which modifies the transition rates to neighbouring cells. This field, which can be discrete or continuous, is subject to diffusion and decay. Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore, the model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a virtual rather than a chemical trace. Our main goal is to show that the introduction of such a floor field is sufficient to model collective effects and self-organization encountered in pedestrian dynamics, e.g. lane formation in counterflow through a large corridor. As an application we also present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with reduced visibility, e.g. due to failure of lights or smoke.},

  Abstract                 = {Walking is the most common terrestrial form of locomotion in animals. Its great versatility and flexibility has led to many attempts at building walking machines with similar capabilities. The control of walking is an active research area both in neurobiology and robotics, with a large and growing body of work. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge on the control of legged locomotion in animals and machines and attempts to give walking control researchers from biology and robotics an overview of the current knowledge in both fields. We try to summarize the knowledge on the neurobiological basis of walking control in animals, emphasizing common principles seen in different species. In a section on walking robots, we review common approaches to walking controller design with a slight emphasis on biped walking control. We show where parallels between robotic and neurobiological walking controllers exist and how robotics and biology may benefit from each other. Finally, we discuss where research in the two fields diverges and suggest ways to bridge these gaps.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Gauss-Newton with approximated tensors (GNAT) method is a nonlinear model-reduction method that operates on fully discretized computational models. It achieves dimension reduction by a Petrov-Galerkin projection associated with residual minimization; it delivers computational efficiency by a hyper-reduction procedure based on the 'gappy POD' technique. Originally presented in Ref. [1], where it was applied to implicit nonlinear structural-dynamics models, this method is further developed here and applied to the solution of a benchmark turbulent viscous flow problem. To begin, this paper develops global state-space error bounds that justify the method's design and highlight its advantages in terms of minimizing components of these error bounds. Next, the paper introduces a 'sample mesh' concept that enables a distributed, computationally efficient implementation of the \{GNAT\} method in finite-volume-based computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) codes. The suitability of \{GNAT\} for parameterized problems is highlighted with the solution of an academic problem featuring moving discontinuities. Finally, the capability of this method to reduce by orders of magnitude the core-hours required for large-scale \{CFD\} computations, while preserving accuracy, is demonstrated with the simulation of turbulent flow over the Ahmed body. For an instance of this benchmark problem with over 17 million degrees of freedom, \{GNAT\} outperforms several other nonlinear model-reduction methods, reduces the required computational resources by more than two orders of magnitude, and delivers a solution that differs by less than 1% from its high-dimensional counterpart.},

Interactions between particles are specified by means of a pairwise potential, repulsive at short ranges and attractive at longer ranges. The exponentially decaying Morse potential is a typical choice, and is known to reproduce certain types of collective motion observed in nature, particularly aligned flocks and rotating mills. We introduce a class of interaction potentials, that we call Quasi-Morse, for which flock and rotating mills states are also observed numerically, however in that case the corresponding macroscopic equations allow for explicit solutions in terms of special functions, with coefficients that can be obtained numerically without solving the particle evolution. We compare the obtained solutions with long-time dynamics of the particle systems and find a close agreement for several types of flock and mill solutions.},

  abstract = {Much of the guidance available to engineers regarding human-induced bridge vibration and the lateral instability phenomenon that can occur has resulted from experience of 'one-off' bridge loading events such as the London Millennium and Paris Solf\'{e}rino bridges. This has resulted in restrictive design criteria for pedestrian numbers and acceleration limits. However, this area has been the subject of extensive research over more than a decade. As a consequence, improved understanding of the problem has enabled the development of better modelling and simulation tools. In this paper, human-induced vibration is considered from two viewpoints, (i) the interaction that takes place between individual walking pedestrians and the vibrating bridge, and (ii) the wider crowd behaviour that results from the interactions between pedestrians. The current state of the art is identified in each area and a modelling framework is presented that couples both. A discrete element crowd model is coupled with a dynamical system. The dynamical system models interaction between multiple inverted pendulum (IP) biomechanical models and a SDoF system representing a bridge vibration mode. Both the crowd model and dynamical system are coupled in a time-stepping framework with crowd model output used to update the dynamical system at each time-step. The model is then used to simulate the multi-modal response of the Clifton Suspension Bridge (CSB), previously documented in the literature. Model predictions show good agreement with observations from the CSB. Most notably, lateral instability develops in a mode at 0.52 Hz followed by instability in a second at 0.75 Hz, without step frequency tuning among the crowd, in line with observations. Furthermore, the model suggests that instability in mode L2 may have lead directly to development of instability in mode L3. The existence of a feedback mechanism has been confirmed and is identified as resulting from amplitude modulation of the lateral ground reaction force. This mechanism results from alteration of the lateral position of the foot in successive steps in response to base oscillations.},

This neural-level representation is considered to support a "direct activation" of action by perception/imagination of movement at the behavioral level. We examine how this two-tier model, where a representation at the neural level supports "direct activation" at the behavioral level, relates to the notion of situatedness---the real-time access and use of environment structure for cognition. Reviewing four leading environment-oriented approaches to cognition (ecological psychology, situated action, distributed cognition, and ecological rationality), we show that the access and use of the environment structures proposed by three of these approaches require a mechanism that supports both representations and direct access. We argue that the two-tier common coding model provides such an integrated mechanism, and, further, it extends and refines the notion of direct perception.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulating traffic flow is an important problem in transport planning. The most popular simulation approaches for large-scale scenarios today are aggregated models. Unfortunately, these models lack temporal and spatial resolution. But microsimulations are interesting for traffic flow simulation, as they can accurately simulate features requiring both high temporal and high spatial resolution, including traffic jams and peak periods. However, most microscopic approaches involve high computational costs and expensive large computers to run them within a reasonable time. This work presents possibilities for reducing these costs by using a queue-based model and an event-driven approach jointly. The approach makes it possible to run large-scale scenarios with more than 1 million simulated person-days on networks with 10,000 links in less than 10 min on single CPU desktop computers present in most offices today.},

  abstract  = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

  abstract  = {The adoption of detailed mechanisms for chemical kinetics often poses two types of severe challenges: First, the number of degrees of freedom is large; and second, the dynamics is characterized by widely disparate time scales. As a result, reactive flow solvers with detailed chemistry often become intractable even for large clusters of CPUs, especially when dealing with direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent combustion problems. This has motivated the development of several techniques for reducing the complexity of such kinetics models, where eventually only a few variables are considered in the development of the simplified model. Unfortunately, no generally applicable a priori recipe for selecting suitable parameterizations of the reduced model is available, and the choice of slow variables often relies upon intuition and experience. We present an automated approach to this task, consisting of three main steps. First, the low dimensional manifold of slow motions is (approximately) sampled by brief simulations of the detailed model, starting from a rich enough ensemble of admissible initial conditions. Second, a global parameterization of the manifold is obtained through the Diffusion Map (DMAP) approach, which has recently emerged as a powerful tool in data analysis/machine learning. Finally, a simplified model is constructed and solved on the fly in terms of the above reduced (slow) variables. Clearly, closing this latter model requires nontrivial interpolation calculations, enabling restriction (mapping from the full ambient space to the reduced one) and lifting (mapping from the reduced space to the ambient one). This is a key step in our approach, and a variety of interpolation schemes are reported and compared. The scope of the proposed procedure is presented and discussed by means of an illustrative combustion example.},

Therefore, vehicular traffic, modeled as a system of interacting particles driven far from equilibrium, offers the possibility to study various fundamental aspects of truly nonequilibrium systems which are of current interest in statistical physics. Analytical as well as numerical techniques of statistical physics are being used to study these models to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by vehicular traffic. Some of these phenomena, observed in vehicular traffic under different circumstances, include transitions from one dynamical phase to another, criticality and self-organized criticality, metastability and hysteresis, phase-segregation, etc. In this critical review, written from the perspective of statistical physics, we explain the guiding principles behind all the main theoretical approaches. But we present detailed discussions on the results obtained mainly from the so-called particle-hopping models, particularly emphasizing those which have been formulated in recent years using the language of cellular automata.},

In this article we conduct functional PCA for the trajectories of pedestrians passing through a bottleneck. We benchmark two agent based models of pedestrian flow against the experimental data using PCA average and stochastic features. Functional PCA proves to be an efficient tool to detect deviation between simulation and experiment and to asses quality of pedestrian models.},

We studied and implemented an implicit numerical method for solving the high-order flow conservation traffic model on parallel computers. Implicit methods allow much larger time-step than explicit methods, for the same accuracy. However, at each time-step a nonlinear system must be solved. We used the Newton method coupled with a linear iterative method (Orthomin). We accelerated the convergence of Orthomin with parallel incomplete \{LU\} factorization preconditionings. We ran simulation tests with real traffic data from an 12-mile freeway section (in Minnesota) on the nCUBE2 parallel computer. These tests gave the same accuracy as past tests, which were performed on one-processor computers, and the overall execution time was significantly reduced.},

Two male and two female Ss were tested by 24 undergraduate Es; the stop-distance technique was used for both conditions. There was a significant difference between the personal space distances in the two locations. Interpersonal closeness produced less discomfort in open spaces than in vertically restricted areas. These results support a spheroid model in which personal space extends in vertical as well as horizontal directions.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

  abstract  = {The concise representation of complex high dimensional stochastic systems via a few reduced coordinates is an important problem in computational physics, chemistry, and biology. In this paper we use the first few eigenfunctions of the backward Fokker-Planck diffusion operator as a coarse-grained low dimensional representation for the long-term evolution of a stochastic system and show that they are optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. We denote the mapping from physical space to these eigenfunctions as the diffusion map. While in high dimensional systems these eigenfunctions are difficult to compute numerically by conventional methods such as finite differences or finite elements, we describe a simple computational data-driven method to approximate them from a large set of simulated data. Our method is based on defining an appropriately weighted graph on the set of simulated data and computing the first few eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the corresponding random walk matrix on this graph. Thus, our algorithm incorporates the local geometry and density at each point into a global picture that merges data from different simulation runs in a natural way. Furthermore, we describe lifting and restriction operators between the diffusion map space and the original space. These operators facilitate the description of the coarse-grained dynamics, possibly in the form of a low dimensional effective free energy surface parameterized by the diffusion map reduction coordinates. They also enable a systematic exploration of such effective free energy surfaces through the design of additional "intelligently biased" computational experiments. We conclude by demonstrating our method in a few examples.},

The extension process that we describe involves the construction of a speci?c family of functions that we term geometric harmonics. These functions constitute a generalization of the prolate spheroidal wave functions of Slepian in the sense that they are optimally concentrated on X. We study the case when X is a submanifold of Rn in greater detail. In this situation, any empirical function f on X can be characterized by its decomposition over the intrinsic Fourier modes, i.e., the eigenfunctions of the Laplace?Beltrami operator, and we show that this intrinsic frequency spectrum determines the largest domain of extension of f to the entire space Rn. Our analysis relates the complexity of the function on the training set to the scale of extension off this set. This approach allows us to present a novel multiscale extension scheme for empirical functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans tend to swing their arms when they walk, a curious behaviour since the arms play no obvious role in bipedal gait. It might be costly to use muscles to swing the arms, and it is unclear whether potential benefits elsewhere in the body would justify such costs. To examine these costs and benefits, we developed a passive dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms. Even with no torques driving the arms or legs, the model produced walking gaits with arm swinging similar to humans. Passive gaits with arm phasing opposite to normal were also found, but these induced a much greater reaction moment from the ground, which could require muscular effort in humans. We therefore hypothesized that the reduction of this moment may explain the physiological benefit of arm swinging. Experimental measurements of humans (n = 10) showed that normal arm swinging required minimal shoulder torque, while volitionally holding the arms still required 12 per cent more metabolic energy. Among measures of gait mechanics, vertical ground reaction moment was most affected by arm swinging and increased by 63 per cent without it. Walking with opposite-to-normal arm phasing required minimal shoulder effort but magnified the ground reaction moment, causing metabolic rate to increase by 26 per cent. Passive dynamics appear to make arm swinging easy, while indirect benefits from reduced vertical moments make it worthwhile overall.},

  abstract  = {The spatial environments in which humans and animals navigate tend to be complex and dynamic, and are often characterized by information shortage. Getting around is a fundamental, adaptive problem for many individuals, but one they are capable of solving with remarkable speed and accuracy. In this chapter, it is argued that what on occasion appears to be a complex behavior based on internal representations is often the outcome of simple mechanisms - termed fast and frugal heuristics - and their interaction with the environment. Thus, the spatial navigation decisions made by individuals can be characterized as "good enough" rather than optimal, and are often crucially dependent on the environments in which they operate. This chapter reviews approaches from navigation research that differ in their emphasis on environment versus internal spatial representations in explaining movement behavior and offers an explanation of human movement behavior in terms of relatively simple mechanisms that can exploit properties of the task environment. The main contention put forward here is that a large part of explanatory power would be lost by focusing merely on the underlying cognitive processes without reference to the structure of the environment(s) in which those processes operate.},

  abstract = {Predictions from science and engineering models depend on several input parameters. Global sensitivity analysis quantifies the importance of each input parameter, which can lead to insight into the model and reduced computational cost; commonly used sensitivity metrics include Sobol' total sensitivity indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for identifying important directions in a model's input parameter space; these directions can be exploited to reduce the model's dimension enabling otherwise infeasible parameter studies. In this paper, we develop global sensitivity metrics called activity scores from the active subspace, which yield insight into the important model parameters. We mathematically relate the activity scores to established sensitivity metrics, and we discuss computational methods to estimate the activity scores. We show two numerical examples with algebraic functions taken from simplified engineering models. For each model, we analyze the active subspace and discuss how to exploit the low-dimensional structure. We then show that input rankings produced by the activity scores are consistent with rankings produced by the standard metrics.},

the female groups. Walking speed was correlated to misalignment between group members when walking. The most frequent spatial arrangement in triads was a v-formation (as seen from above, while the walking direction was from left to right), with the middle individual positioned slightly behind in comparison to the lateral individuals.

Despite a long history of scientific investigation, only now are we beginning to decipher the relationship between individuals and group-level properties. This interdisciplinary effort is beginning to reveal the underlying principles of collective decision-making in animal groups, demonstrating how social interactions, individual state, environmental modification and processes of informational amplification and decay can all play a part in tuning adaptive response. It is proposed that important commonalities exist with the understanding of neuronal processes and that much could be learned by considering collective animal behavior in the framework of cognitive science.},

It is an ideal species in which to test the predictions of our model because it forms pheromone trails that are densely populated with very swift ants.

The behaviour of real army ants is such that they occupy the specific region of parameter space in which lanes form and traffic flow is maximized.},

It has previously been argued, for humans and animals, that social groups containing individuals who are uninformed, or exhibit weak preferences, are particularly vulnerable to such manipulative agents. Here, we use theory and experiment to demonstrate that, for a wide range of conditions, a strongly opinionated minority can dictate group choice, but the presence of uninformed individuals spontaneously inhibits this process, returning control to the numerical majority. Our results emphasize the role of uninformed individuals in achieving democratic consensus amid internal group conflict and informational constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary The chapter discusses an emerging area of study: that of applying self-organization theory to mobile vertebrate groups composed of many interacting individuals such as bird flocks, ungulate herds, fish schools, and human crowds in an attempt to improve our understanding of underlying organizational principles. Mathematical modeling is becoming increasingly recognized as an important research tool when studying collective behavior. The chapter presents the interaction dynamics among individuals result in the formation, internal structuring, and collective behaviors of vertebrate groups. The chapter explores the distribution of grouping individuals over larger spatial and temporal scales, and discusses how individual behaviors lead to population-level dynamics. Behavioral differences among individuals within a group may have an important internal structuring influence. By using simulation models, it can be shown how individuals can modify their positions relative to other group members without necessitating information about their current position within the group. In considering self-organization within vertebrate groups it is evident that the organization at one level, for example, that of the group relates to that at higher levels. For example, self-sorting processes that lead to internal structuring within groups also result in population-level patterns when such groups fragment, thus affecting the probability that an individual will be in a group of a given size and composition at any moment in time. These population properties then feed back to the individual interactions by changing the probability of encounters among different members of a population. The chapter concludes that to understand collective behaviors fully, these properties cannot necessarily be considered in isolation.},

Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information. We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems.},

Further, we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole.

The background idea is indeed that most of the complex trends exhibited by crowds are due to an intrinsic interplay between individual and collective behaviors. The modeling approach promoted in this book pursues actively this intuition and profits from it for designing general mathematical structures susceptible of application also in fields different from the inspiring original one. The book considers also the two most traditional points of view: the microscopic one, in which pedestrians are tracked individually and the macroscopic one, in which pedestrians are assimilated to a continuum. Selected existing models are critically analyzed. The work is addressed to researchers and graduate students.},

complex environments. The work covers two major topics. In the first part, a novel cellular automaton (CA)
model is proposed. The model describes the pedestrian movement by a set of simple rules and produces fundamental
diagrams similar to those derived from laboratory experiments. The second topic of this work describes how
the CA can be integrated into an iterative learning cycle where the individual pedestrian can adapt travel plans
based on experiences from previous iterations. Depending on the setup, the overall travel behavior moves either
toward a Nash equilibrium or the system optimum. The functional interaction of the CA with the iterative
learning approach is demonstrated on a set of transport paradoxes. Furthermore, time series of speed and density
observed in a small-scale experiment show a general agreement between the CA simulation and laboratory experiments.
The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a large-scale scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {For moving animals, the successful avoidance of hazardous obstacles is an important capability. Despite this, few models of collective motion have addressed the relationship between behavioural and social features and obstacle avoidance. We develop an asynchronous individual-based model for social movement which allows social structure within groups to be included. We assess the dynamics of group navigation and resulting collision risk in the context of information transfer through the system. In agreement with previous work, we find that group size has a nonlinear effect on collision risk. We implement examples of possible network structures to explore the impact social preferences have on collision risk. We show that any social heterogeneity induces greater obstacle avoidance with further improvements corresponding to groups containing fewer influential individuals. The model provides a platform for both further theoretical investigation and practical application. In particular, we argue that the role of social structures within bird flocks may have an important role to play in assessing the risk of collisions with wind turbines, but that new methods of data analysis are needed to identify these social structures.},

The Tawaf serves as a unique test case; the large crowd consists of a heterogeneous set of pilgrims, varying in both physical capacity and activity. Furthermore, the density of the crowd reaches extremely high levels (up to 8 people/m2). This extreme density can place impractical constraints on simulation parameters. We use a velocity-space-based pedestrian model which exhibits consistent results even under extreme density: reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO). Furthermore, we extend RVO to include priority and right of way-agents respond to potential collisions asymmetrically depending on context; one agent may yield, to varying degrees, to another. Our system uses a finite state machine to specify the behavior of the agents at each time step, to model the varied behaviors seen during the Tawaf. The finite-state machine, used in conjunction with RVO, generates collision-free trajectories for tens of thousands of agents in the performance of the Tawaf. The overall system can model agents with varying age, gender and behaviors, supporting the heterogeneity observed in the performance of the Tawaf, even at high densities.},

In general, these symmetric relationships are valid for a large number of crowd simulation scenarios. However, there are many cases in which symmetric responses between agents are inappropriate, leading to unrealistic behavior or undesirable simulation artifacts.We present a novel formulation, called right of way, which provides a well-disciplined mechanism for modeling asymmetric relationships between pedestrians. Right of way is a general principle, which can be applied to different types of pedestrianmodels.We illustrate this by applying right of way to three different pedestrian models (two based on social forces and one based on velocity obstacles) and show its impact in multiple scenarios. Particularly, we show how it enables simulation of the complex relationships exhibited by pilgrims performing the Islamic religious ritual, the Tawaf.},

Indeed, when we decide to work hard on a task, it feels as if that conscious decision is the first and foremost cause of our behavior. That is, we are likely to say, if asked, that the decision to act produced the actions themselves. Recent discoveries, however, challenge this causal status of conscious will. They demonstrate that under some conditions, actions are initiated even though we are unconscious of the goals to be attained or their motivating effect on our behavior.

The model is constructed from a set of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, using the velocity field data obtained in previous experiments. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is as a technique which allows the extraction of the significant modes of a flow. It permits to identify modes without any a priori hypothesis, and these are ordered by their associated level of energy. The POD modes are used to formulate a dynamical system which only contains the main features of the flow, a low order dynamical system(LODS). This is achieved by means of a Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes Equations with the goal to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations describing the main aspects of the flow without demanding excessive computational requirements.},

  abstract = {The value of a pedestrian stream simulation depends on its ability to reproduce natural behaviour of pedestrians in different situations. Most models assume that pedestrians are single-minded and constantly move towards their destinations. However, our observa- tions at two major German railway stations made during field experiments and our anal- ysis of video recordings at one of these stations revealed that in virtually every setting a significant proportion of pedestrians do not walk continuously. Instead, they occasionally change their route in order to visit certain locations and stand there for a period of time. By waiting, they often block walking pedestrians and thereby influence the overall dynam- ics. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of waiting pedestrians and propose a model for waiting pedestrians based on cellular automata. The model is able to reproduce the observed pedestrian behaviour. We illustrate the model with simulations of several real life scenarios for a major German railway station and show that during rush hour standing pedestrians may prolong walking time by up to nearly 20%. We also demonstrate how the developed model can be used for the analysis of infrastructures, and prediction of prob- lematic areas in public spaces.},

  abstract = {People die or get injured at mass events when the crowd gets out of control. Urbanization and the increasing popularity of mass events, from soccer games to religious celebrations, enforce this trend. Thus, there is a strong need to better control crowd behavior. Here, simulation of pedestrian streams can be very helpful: Simulations allow a user to run through a number of scenarios in a critical situation and thereby to investigate adequate measures to improve security. In order to make realistic, reliable predictions, a model must be able to reproduce the data known from experiments quantitatively. Therefore, automatic and fast calibration methods are needed that can easily adapt model parameters to different scenarios. Also, the model must be robust. Small changes or measurement errors in the crucial input parameters must not lead to disproportionally large changes in the simulation outcome and thus potentially useless results. In this paper we present two methods to automatically calibrate pedestrian simulations to the socio-cultural parameters captured through measured fundamental diagrams. We then introduce a concept of robustness to compare the two methods. In particular, we propose a quantitative estimation of parameter quality and a method of parameter selection based on a criterion for robustness. We discuss the results of our test scenarios and, based on our experience, propose further steps.},

  abstract = {Building a reliable predictive model of pedestrian motion is very challenging: Ideally, such models should be based on observations made in both controlled experiments and in real-world environments. De facto, models are rarely based on real-world observations due to the lack of available data; instead, they are largely based on intuition and, at best, literature values and laboratory experiments. Such an approach is insufficient for reliable simulations of complex real-life scenarios: For instance, our analysis of pedestrian motion under natural conditions at a major German railway station reveals that the values for free-flow velocities and the flow-density relationship differ significantly from widely used literature values. It is thus necessary to calibrate and validate the model against relevant real-life data to make it capable of reproducing and predicting real-life scenarios. In this work we aim at constructing such realistic pedestrian stream simulation. Based on the analysis of real-life data, we present a methodology that identifies key parameters and interdependencies that enable us to properly calibrate the model. The success of the approach is demonstrated for a benchmark model, a cellular automaton. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves the reliability of the simulation and hence the potential prediction accuracy. The simulation is validated by comparing the local density evolution of the measured data to that of the simulated data. We find that for our model the most sensitive parameters are: the source-target distribution of the pedestrian trajectories, the schedule of pedestrian appearances in the scenario and the mean free-flow velocity. Our results emphasize the need for real-life data extraction and analysis to enable predictive simulations.},

Public Health Prep. 3:191-195, 2009) where pedestrians are supposed to have constant speeds. This IBM supposes that pedestrians seek the best compromise between navigation towards their target and collisions avoidance. We first propose a kinetic model for the probability distribution function of pedestrians. Then, we derive fluid models and propose three different closure relations. The first two closures assume that the velocity distribution function is either a Dirac delta or a von Mises-Fisher distribution respectively. The third closure results from a hydrodynamic limit associated to a Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium. We develop an analogy between this equilibrium and Nash equilibria in a game theoretic framework. In each case, we discuss the features of the models and their suitability for practical use.},

  abstract = {To assess a computer model's descriptive and predictive power, the model's response to uncertainties in the input must be quantified. However, simulations of complex systems typically need a lot of computational resources, and thus prohibit exhaustive sweeps of high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the time available to compute a result for decision systems is often very limited. In this paper, we construct a data-driven surrogate model from time delays of observations of a complex, microscopic model. We employ diffusion maps to reduce the dimensionality of the delay space. The surrogate model allows faster generation of the quantity of interest over time than the original, microscopic model. It is a non-intrusive method, and hence does not need access to the model formulation. In contrast to most other surrogate approaches, the construction allows quantities of interest that are not closed dynamically, because a closed state space is constructed through Takens delay embedding. Also, the surrogate can be stored to and loaded from storage with very little effort. The surrogate model is decoupled from the original model, and the fast execution speed allows to quickly evaluate many different parameter distributions. We demonstrate the capability of the approach in combination with forward UQ on a parametrized Burgers? equation, and the microscopic simulation of a train station. The surrogate model can accurately capture the dynamical features in both examples, with relative errors always smaller than ten percent. The simulation time in the real-world example can be reduced by an order of magnitude.},

We show that a certain class of microscopic, ordinary differential equation-based models in crowd dynamics fulfill certain conditions of Hopf bifurcations.

An interesting phenomenon arises: the number of pedestrians in the system must be greater than nine for a bifurcation -- and hence for stop and go waves to be possible at all, independent of the density. Below this number, no parameter setting will cause the system to exhibit a stable stop and go behavior.
The result is also interesting for car traffic, where similar models exist.

  title    = {An ODE-based Model for Pedestrian Motion and Navigation},
  type     = {Bachelor's thesis},
  abstract = {This thesis presents a new model for pedestrian motion and navigation: the Gradient
Navigation Model. It is based on an ODE system where a superposition of gradients
of distance functions changes the direction and length of the velocity vector. A
one-dimensional accelerative term is used to smooth sudden changes in speed. The
approach differs fundamentally from force based models where the acceleration is affected
by forces and in turn changes the velocity.
In the new model, virtual pedestrians navigate along geodesics computed by solving
the Eikonal equation. By directly changing the velocity, the behaviour of individual
pedestrians can be controlled in great detail. This leads to more natural trajectories
and avoids model induced oscillations completely. The model is calibrated by theoretical
arguments based on empirically validated assumptions. All functions included in
the model are presented with smooth dependency on their arguments. This enables a
proof of existence and uniqueness of the solution to the ODE system. The use of fast
and accurate high order numerical integrators is simplified as well.
An implementation of the model in Java is used to validate it against empirical
data. The emergence of several empirically observed system phenomena in various
geometries is shown, such as obstacle avoidance and congestions at bottlenecks. The
parameter set is held constant throughout all tests.
A comparison to the Social Force Model [Helbing and Molnar, 1995] and the Optimal
Steps Model [Seitz and Koester, 2012] reveals that the GNM outperforms them in
terms of oscillatory behaviour and overlapping (SFM) as well as possibilities of mathematical
analysis (OSM).},

We illustrate this by describing our recent work on grouping under conditions of inattention, on change blindness for background events and the residual processing of undetected background changes, on modal versus amodal completion in visual search, and the differential effects of these two forms of completion on attentional processes, and on attentional modulation of lateral interactions thought to arise in early visual cortex. Many of these results indicate that segmentation processes substantially constrain attentional processes, but the reverse influence is also apparent, suggesting an interactive architecture. We discuss how the 'proto-objects' revealed by studies of segmentation and attention (i.e. the segmented perceptual units which constrain selectivity) may relate to other object-based notions in cognitive science, and we wrestle with their relation to phenomenal visual awareness.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach to treat nonlinear operators in reduced basis approximations of parametrized evolution equations. Our approach is based on empirical interpolation of nonlinear differential operators and their Frechet derivatives. Efficient offline/online decomposition is obtained for discrete operators that allow an efficient evaluation for a certain set of interpolation functionals. An a posteriori error estimate for the resulting reduced basis method is derived and analyzed numerically. The approach is applied to nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic equations based on explicit or implicit finite volume discretizations.We show that the resulting reduced scheme is able to capture the evolution of both smooth and discontinuous solutions. In case of symmetries of the problem, the approach realizes an automatic and intuitive space-compression or even space-dimensionality reduction. We perform empirical investigations of the error convergence and runtimes. In all cases we obtain a good runtime acceleration that grows with the problem's size.},

We examined the extent to which crowds are represented in UK emergency planning guidance as psychologically vulnerable or as contributing to psychosocial resilience. A systematic search of 47 guidance documents identified 9 referring to 'panic'. These were discourse analysed, along with six more guidance documents considered key to civil contingencies resilience. It was found that the references to 'panic' served to construct collectives (and particularly crowds) as a source of psychological vulnerability. References to collective sources of resilience in the public were mostly found to be limited and often served to marginalise the crowd as a basis of coping in emergencies. We argue that the emphasis in the current guidance on the marginal role of crowds and the indispensable role of the professionals conflicts with aspects of current policy on community resilience.},

An ethnographic study of the No M11 Link Road Campaign in London examines participants' definitions of their collective identity boundaries at different stages of involvement. Cross-sectional material from the beginning and later in the campaign shows that there was a transformation in collective identity boundaries towards a more inclusive definition of community. Analysis of participants' accounts before and after involvement in the eviction of a tree suggests the role of conflict with the police in producing an oppositional definition of the collective identity, facilitating links to other groups in resistance to illegitimate authority. Finally, biographical material indicates the implications of transformed identity boundaries for co-action with wider social groups. It is argued that the same intra- and inter-group processes that determine how identity boundaries extend to include a broader community might account for how people come to see themselves as part of a global social movement.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper situates contemporary social scientific studies of crowd events and crowd behaviour in their historical and ideological context. The original crowd science developed from definitions of social problems that emerged in the late nineteenth century in particular the concerns among the French establishment about the threat of the mass to civilization. This, and the surrounding intellectual context, encouraged the development of theoretical models of the crowd characterized by forms of reductionism and irrationalism. Early accounts of mass panic similarly suggested that collective behaviour was irrational because it was governed by primitive bio-psychological processes. After describing these early approaches to the crowd, the paper outlines how changes in late twentieth society, whereby those writing about the crowd were no longer necessarily outside crowd events, have coincided with the development of accounts of the crowd which draw upon contemporary social scientific concepts (such as social norms, social identities, and cognition) and which assume that crowds are not alien to meaningful social and political participation, but integral to it.},

  abstract = {Abstract Within the realm of pedestrian research numerous measures have been proposed to estimate the level of crowdedness experienced by pedestrians. However, within the field of pedestrian traffic flow modelling there does not seem to be consensus on the question which of these measures performs best. This paper shows that the shape and scatter within the resulting fundamental diagrams differs a lot depending on the measure of crowdedness used. The main aim of the paper is to establish the advantages and disadvantages of the currently existing measures to quantify crowdedness in order to evaluate which measures provide both accurate and consistent results. The assessment is not only based on the theoretical differences, but also on the qualitative and quantitative differences between the resulting fundamental diagrams computed using the crowdedness measures on one and the same data set. The qualitative and quantitative functioning of the classical Grid-based measure is compared to with the X-T measure, an Exponentially Weighted Distance measure, and a Voronoi-Diagram measure. The consistency of relating these measures for crowdedness to the two macroscopic flow variables velocity and flow, the computational efficiency and the amount of scatter present within the fundamental diagrams produced by the implementation of the different measures are reviewed. It is found that the Voronoi-Diagram and X-T measure are the most efficient and consistent measures for crowdedness.},

  abstract = {Currently, pedestrian simulation models are used to predict where, when and why hazardous high density crowd movements arise. However, it is questionable whether models developed for low density situations can be used to simulate high density crowd movements. The objective of this paper is to assess the existent pedestrian simulation models with respect to known crowd phenomena in order to ascertain whether these models can indeed be used for the simulation of high density crowds and to indicate any gaps in the field of pedestrian simulation modeling research. This paper provides a broad, but not exhaustive overview of the crowd motion simulation models of the last decades. It is argued that any model used for crowd simulation should be able to simulate most of the phenomena indicated in this paper. In the paper cellular automata, social force models, velocity-based models, continuum models, hybrid models, behavioral models and network models are discussed. The comparison shows that the models can roughly be divided into slow but highly precise microscopic modeling attempts and very fast but behaviorally questionable macroscopic modeling attempts. Both sets of models have their use, which is highly dependent on the application the model has originally been developed for. Yet, for practical applications, that need both precision and speed, the current pedestrian simulation models are inadequate.},

We use the OCEAN personality model  as  a  basis  for  agent  psychology.  To  each  personality  trait  we  associate  nominal  behaviors;  thus,  specifying  personality  for  an agent leads to an automation of the low-level parameter tuning process.  We  describe  a  plausible  mapping  from  personality  traits  to existing behavior types and analyze the overall emergent crowd behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {In groups of animals only a small proportion of individuals may possess particular information, such as a migration route or the direction to a resource. Individuals may differ in preferred direction resulting in conflicts of interest and, therefore, consensus decisions may have to be made to prevent the group from splitting. Recent theoretical work has shown how leadership and consensus decision making can occur without active signalling or individual recognition. Here we test these predictions experimentally using humans. We found that a small informed minority could guide a group of na\"ive individuals to a target without verbal communication or obvious signalling. Both the time to target and deviation from target were decreased by the presence of informed individuals. When conflicting directional information was given to different group members, the time taken to reach the target was not significantly increased; suggesting that consensus decision making in conflict situations is possible, and highly efficient. Where there was imbalance in the number of informed individuals with conflicting information, the majority dictated group direction. Our results also suggest that the spatial starting position of informed individuals influences group motion, which has implications in terms of crowd control and planning for evacuations.},

In this paper, we take a close look at some of the algorithms proposed under the "equation-free'' umbrella, the projective integrators and the patch dynamics. We discuss some very simple examples in the context of the "equation-free'' approach. These examples seem to indicate that while its general philosophy is quite attractive and indeed similar to many other approaches in concurrent multiscale modeling, there are severe limitations to the specific implementation proposed by the equation-free approach.},

Although attachment theory and research propose that attachment security provides a person with many adaptive advantages during all phases of the life cycle, numerous studies indicate that almost half of the human species can be classified as insecurely attached or insecure with respect to attachment. It seems odd that evolution left humans in this vulnerable position unless there are some advantages, under at least some conditions, to anxious and avoidant attachment styles. We argue that a social group containing members with different attachment patterns may be more conducive to survival than a homogeneous group of securely attached individuals. In making this argument, we extend the scope of attachment theory and research by considering a broader range of adaptive functions of insecure attachment strategies.

Yet it may be advantageous for groups to include insecure as well as secure members. The authors tested predictions from social defense theory concerning advantages to groups of including members with different attachment patterns. A total of 46 groups were unobtrusively observed in a threatening laboratory situation: The room gradually filled with smoke, apparently because of a malfunctioning computer. Attachment anxiety was associated with quicker detection of the danger and therefore with greater group effectiveness. Attachment-related avoidance was associated with speedier escape responses to the danger once it was detected and therefore with greater group safety. The results remained significant even when extraversion and neuroticism, two possible confounds, were statistically controlled. Implications of the findings for theory and research concerning group processes, threat detection, and individual differences in attachment are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Finding coarse-grained, low-dimensional descriptions is an important task in the analysis of complex, stochastic models of gene regulatory networks. This task involves (a) identifying observables that best describe the state of these complex systems and (b) characterizing the dynamics of the observables. In a previous paper [R. Erban et al., J. Chem. Phys.124, 084106 (2006)] the authors assumed that good observables were known a priori, and presented an equation-free approach to approximate coarse-grained quantities (i.e., effective drift and diffusion coefficients) that characterize the long-time behavior of the observables. Here we use diffusion maps [R. Coifman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.102, 7426 (2005)] to extract appropriate observables ("reduction coordinates") in an automated fashion; these involve the leading eigenvectors of a weighted Laplacian on a graph constructed from network simulation data. We present lifting and restriction procedures for translating between physical variables and these data-based observables. These procedures allow us to perform equation-free, coarse-grained computations characterizing the long-term dynamics through the design and processing of short bursts of stochastic simulation initialized at appropriate values of the data-based observables.},

  abstract  = {The movement of many organisms can be described as a random walk at either or both the individual and population level. The rules for this random walk are based on complex biological processes and it may be difficult to develop a tractable, quantitatively-accurate, individual-level model. However, important problems in areas ranging from ecology to medicine involve large collections of individuals, and a further intellectual challenge is to model population-level behavior based on a detailed individual-level model. Because of the large number of interacting individuals and because the individual-level model is complex, classical direct Monte Carlo simulations can be very slow, and often of little practical use. In this case, an equation-free approach [I.G. Kevrekidis, C.W. Gear, J.M. Hyman, P. Kevrekidis, O. Runborg, K. Theodoropoulos, Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level analysis, Commun. Math. Sci. 1 (4) (2003) 715-762] may provide effective methods for the analysis and simulation of individual-based models. In this paper we analyze equation-free coarse projective integration. For analytical purposes, we start with known partial differential equations describing biological random walks and we study the projective integration of these equations. In particular, we illustrate how to accelerate explicit numerical methods for solving these equations. Then we present illustrative kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of these random walks and show that a decrease in computational time by as much as a factor of a thousand can be obtained by exploiting the ideas developed by analysis of the closed form PDEs. The illustrative biological example here is chemotaxis, but it could be any random walker that biases its movement in response to environmental cues.},

  Abstract                 = {In structural optimization, usually an approximation concept is introduced as interface between (FEM) structural analysis code and optimization algorithm. In some cases of optimum design, a global approximation concept can be effectively applied. Then, approximation model functions are built of all objective and constraint functions, whose values, for a certain design point, follow from the structural analysis calculations. In this way, the original optimization problem is completely replaced by an explicitly known approximate optimization problem. Response-surface techniques are commonly applied to build global approximation models, especially when dealing with responses of physical experiments. For one response function, this means that a user defined model function is fitted to the response data calculated at the design sites of some experimental design. Errors between model function and experimental response values are assumed to be randomly distributed. However, in the structural optimization case, an experiment is a computer analysis with a deterministic response as a result. This rules out the statistical assumptions response-surface model building is based upon. Furthermore, it is often diffcult to find model functions that approximate the true response behaviour within the desired accuracy. Sacks and coworkers proposed a new model building strategy, that is especially suited for deterministic computer responses. Their basic assumption is that computer responses can be modelled as a realization of a stochastic process. This finally leads to a response prediction that exactly describes all calculated computer responses. Additionally, the mean squared error of a prediction can be calculated, which serves as a measure of accuracy of the prediction. A review is given of the method of Sacks et al.. It has been implemented in MATLAB. Some analytical response functions and small design optimization problems have been used to test the model building capacities and the effectiveness of the method when applied as global approximation concept in structural optimization. It is concluded that the strategy as proposed by Sacks and coworkers is not suited for implementation in a design optimization tool, mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, maximum likelihood parameter estimation is computationally expensive and not straightforward, while the quality of the parameter estimations is questionable. This computational effort is disadvantageous if many constraint functions have to approximated, which often occurs in structural optimization. Secondly, the mean squared error can not be unconditionally trusted. To have an independent accuracy measure several additional computer experiments (test points) have to be performed. Main advantage of the approximations of Sacks et al., compared with response-surface models, is the exibility to automatically adapt to the calculated response data. The same sort of exibility also occurs for the moving least-squares variant of the least-squares parameter estimation. It is recommended to investigate whether this method can add exibility to, and solve the model function selection problems of, the response-surface strategy without an unmanageable amount of computations.},

When people had to sit close to other passengers, they experienced adverse reactions. These results are consistent with prior work indicating that individual spacing among persons that leads to personal space invasions is a more salient environmental condition than density per se. The findings also have implications for the design of mass transit vehicles.},

  Abstract                 = {A one-dimensional driven lattice gas with disorder in the particle hopping probabilities is considered. It has previously been shown that in the version of the model with random sequential updating, a phase transition occurs from a low-density inhomogeneous phase to a high-density congested phase. Here the steady states for both parallel (fully synchronous) updating and ordered sequential updating are solved exactly. The phase transition is shown to persist in both cases with the critical densities being higher than that for random sequential dynamics. The steady-state velocities are related to the fugacity of a Bose system suggesting a principle of minimization of velocity. A generalization of the dynamics, to the case where the hopping probabilities depend on the number of empty sites in front of the particles, is also solved exactly in the case of parallel updating. The models have natural interpretations as simplistic descriptions of traffic flow. The relation to more sophisticated traffic flow models is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Social information use is common in a wide range of group-living animals, notably in humans. We investigated social information use by pedestrians in a potentially dangerous scenario: at a road crossing. To judge a safe gap in traffic, pedestrians can use social information, such as the crossing behavior of others, and follow others across the road. We tested if pedestrians followed others in this scenario by analyzing pedestrian starting position and crossing order. First, we found that neighbors of a crossing pedestrian tended to cross before other waiting pedestrians and that this tendency was significantly higher in observed pedestrians than in a null model: a simulation in which pedestrians did not follow each other. Also, by fitting the null model, we found that on average a person was 1.5-2.5 times more likely to cross if their neighbor had started to cross. Second, we found that males tended to follow others more than females. Third, we observed that some individuals started to cross and then returned to the roadside. These individuals were more frequently found in groups and tended to start to cross relatively later than other pedestrians. These observations suggest that some of these individuals made incorrect decisions about the timing of their crossing and that this was due to social information use. Finally, we propose that the relatively small benefit of a reduced waiting time came at the cost of an increased risk of injury, making the beneficial value of social information use questionable in this context.},

  abstract  = {Human motion models are finding an increasing number of novel applications in many different fields, such as building design, computer graphics and robot motion planning. The Social Force Model is one of the most popular alternatives to describe the motion of pedestrians. By resorting to a physical analogy, individuals are assimilated to point-wise particles subject to social forces which drive their dynamics. Such a model implicitly assumes that humans move isotropically. On the contrary, empirical evidence shows that people do have a preferred direction of motion, walking forward most of the time. Lateral motions are observed only in specific circumstances, such as when navigating in overcrowded environments or avoiding unexpected obstacles. In this paper, the Headed Social Force Model is introduced in order to improve the realism of the trajectories generated by the classical Social Force Model. The key feature of the proposed approach is the inclusion of the pedestriansheading into the dynamic model used to describe the motion of each individual. The force and torque representing the model inputs are computed as suitable functions of the force terms resulting from the traditional Social Force Model. Moreover, a new force contribution is introduced in order to model the behavior of people walking together as a single group. The proposed model features high versatility, being able to reproduce both the unicycle-like trajectories typical of people moving in open spaces and the point-wise motion patterns occurring in high density scenarios. Extensive numerical simulations show an increased regularity of the resulting trajectories and confirm a general improvement of the model realism.},

The decomposition indicates that the worm has a multi-modal posturing behavior, involving at least a dominant locomotion mode and a secondary, steering mode. The locomotion mode is closer to a pure traveling waveform than the steering mode. The characteristic wavelength of the primary mode was estimated in the complex plane. Frequency was obtained from the complex modal coordinate's complex whirl rate of the complex modal coordinate, and from its fast Fourier transform.},

In order to calibrate the model's parameters and to validate it we used data obtained from an empirical observation of bidirectional pedestrian flow. A good agreement was found between numerical simulation and experimental data and, in particular, the double outflow peak observed during the formation of deadlocks could be reproduced in numerical simulations, thus allowing the analysis of deadlock formation and dissolution. Finally, we used the developed high density model to compute the flow-ratio dependent fundamental diagram of bidirectional flow, demonstrating the instability of balanced flow and predicting the bidirectional flow behavior at very high densities. The model we presented here can be used to prevent dense crowd accidents in the future and to investigate the dynamics of the accidents which already occurred in the past. Additionally, fields such as granular and active matter physics may benefit from the developed framework to study different collective phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {Everybody would agree that vision guides locomotion; but how does vision influence choice when there are different solutions for possible foot placement? We addressed this question by investigating the impact of perceptual grouping on foot placement in humans. Participants performed a stepping stone task in which pathways consisted of target stones in a spatially regular path of foot falls and visual distractor stones in their proximity. Target and distractor stones differed in shape and colour so that each subset of stones could be easily grouped perceptually. In half of the trials, one target stone swapped shape and colour with a distractor in its close proximity. We show that in these {\textquoteleft}swapped{\textquoteright} conditions, participants chose the perceptually groupable, instead of the spatially regular, stepping location in over 40\% of trials, even if the distance between perceptually groupable steps was substantially larger than normal step width/length. This reveals that the existence of a pathway that could be traversed without spatial disruption to periodic stepping is not sufficient to guarantee participants will select it and suggests competition between different types of visual input when choosing foot placement. We propose that a bias in foot placement choice in favour of visual grouping exists as, in nature, sudden changes in visual characteristics of the ground increase the uncertainty for stability.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of multiple sensory cues is essential for precise and accurate perception and behavioral performance, yet the reliability of sensory signals can vary across modalities and viewing conditions. Human observers typically employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is generally consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a simple and widespread form of statistical inference.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of a determining form for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which is an ODE on a space of trajectories is completely described. It is proved that at every stage of its evolution, the solution is a convex combination of the initial trajectory and the fixed steady state, with a dynamical convexity parameter $\theta$, which will be called the characteristic determining parameter. That is, we show a remarkable separation of variables formula for the solution of the determining form. Moreover, for a given initial trajectory, the dynamics of the infinite-dimensional determining form are equivalent to those of the characteristic determining parameter $\theta$ which is governed by a one-dimensional ODE. %for the parameter specifying the position on the line segment. This one-dimensional ODE is used to show that if the solution to the determining form converges to the fixed state it does so no faster than $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-1/2})$, otherwise it converges to a projection of some other trajectory in the global attractor of the NSE, but no faster than $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-1})$, as $\tau \to \infty$, where $\tau$ is the evolutionary variable in determining form. The one-dimensional ODE also exploited in computations which suggest that the one-sided convergence rate estimates are in fact achieved. The ODE is then modified to accelerate the convergence to an exponential rate. Remarkably, it is shown that the zeros of the scalar function that governs the dynamics of $\theta$, which are called characteristic determining values, identify in a unique fashion the trajectories in the global attractor of the 2D NSE. Furthermore, the one-dimensional characteristic determining form enables us to find unanticipated geometric features of the global attractor, a subject of future research.},

Rather, this issue is said to be settled by prior probabilities, by simplicity, or by a background theory. In this paper, we describe a result due to Akaike [1973], which shows how the data can underwrite an inference concerning the curve's form based on an estimate of how predictively accurate it will be. We argue that this approach throws light on the theoretical virtues of parsimoniousness, unification, and non ad hocness, on the dispute about Bayesianism, and on empiricism and scientific realism.},

For such an approximated system we prove existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions (in one space dimension) in the sense of Kruzkov [22], in which the boundary conditions are posed following the approach of Bardos et al. [7]. We use BV estimates on the density and stability estimates on the potential in order to prove uniqueness. Furthermore, we analyse the evolution of characteristics for the original Hughes' model in one space dimension and study the behaviour of simple solutions, in order to reproduce interesting phenomena related to the formation of shocks and rarefaction waves. The characteristic calculus is supported by numerical simulations.},

Several authors have called attention to the fact that placing an obstacle near the exit improves the evacuation time of the room (Helbing et al. (2000, 2005) [2,8], Hughes (2003) [6], Johansson and Helbing (2005) [16], Piccoli and Tosin (2009) [5]). We studied this effect in the context of the "social force model" (Helbing et al. (2000) [2]). We show that placing an obstacle does not guarantee, by itself, better chances of survival for all pedestrians. The way they choose to avoid the obstacle is critical for their own performance. We found not only that the faster they try to escape, the slower they get out ("faster is slower" effect), but also, the short cut they might take in order to get to the exit will probably do no better ("clever is not always better" effect).},

  abstract = {Abstract Random slowdown process and lock-step effect, observed from real-life observation and the experiments of other researchers, were investigated in the view of the pedestrian microscopic behaviors. Due to the limited controllability, repeatability and randomness of the pedestrian experiments, a new estimating-correction cellular automaton was established to research the influence of random slowdown process and lock-step effect on the fundamental diagram. The first step of the model is to estimate the next time-step status of the neighbor cell in front of the tracked pedestrian. The second step is to correct the status and confirm the position of the tracked pedestrian in the next time-step. It is found that the random slowdown process and lock-step have significant influence on the curve configuration and the characteristic parameters, including the concavity-convexity, the inflection point, the maximum flow rate and the critical density etc. The random slowdown process reduces the utilization of the available space between two adjacent pedestrians in the longitudinal direction, especially in the region of intermediate density. However, the lock-step effect enhances the utilization of the available space, especially in the region of high density.},

As an example of its application, we develop a model to predict the walking speed of a pedestrian on stairs. We examine the physiology and biomechanics of walking on stairs, and then develop a model that predicts walking speed based on the weight and leg extensor power of the pedestrian, and the gradient of the stairs. The model was calibrated by experiment and validated by observations. The proposed framework establishes the importance of bridging the two types of characteristics: those of a pedestrian and those of the facility the pedestrian uses. Also, the developed walking speed model is useful for simulating how the design of stairs affects pedestrian circulation.},

The analysis makes use of response time data derived from a study of published WTC survivor accounts. Geometric details of the building are obtained from architects' plans while the total building population used in the scenarios is based on estimates produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology formal investigation into the evacuation. This paper attempts to approximate the events of 11 September 2001 and pursue several `what if' questions concerning the evacuation. In particular, the study explores the likely outcome had a single staircase survived intact from top to bottom. More generally, this paper explores issues associated with the practical limits of building size that can be expected to be efficiently evacuated using stairs alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedestrian crowds can form the substrate of important socially contagious behaviors, including propagation of visual attention, violence, opinions, and emotional state. However, relating individual to collective behavior is often difficult, and quantitative studies have largely used laboratory experimentation. We present two studies in which we tracked the motion and head direction of 3,325 pedestrians in natural crowds to quantify the extent, influence, and context dependence of socially transmitted visual attention. In our first study, we instructed stimulus groups of confederates within a crowd to gaze up to a single point atop of a building. Analysis of passersby shows that visual attention spreads unevenly in space and that the probability of pedestrians adopting this behavior increases as a function of stimulus group size before saturating for larger groups. We develop a model that predicts that this gaze response will lead to the transfer of visual attention between crowd members, but it is not sufficiently strong to produce a tipping point or critical mass of gaze-following that has previously been predicted for crowd dynamics. A second experiment, in which passersby were presented with two stimulus confederates performing suspicious/irregular activity, supports the predictions of our model. This experiment reveals that visual interactions between pedestrians occur primarily within a 2-m range and that gaze-copying, although relatively weak, can facilitate response to relevant stimuli. Although the above aspects of gaze-following response are reproduced robustly between experimental setups, the overall tendency to respond to a stimulus is dependent on spatial features, social context, and sex of the passerby.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedestrian dynamics plays an important role in public facility design and evacuation management. During an escape process from a large public space, crowd behavior is a collection of pedestrian exit/route choice behavior, and movement behavior. Modelling such an escape process is an extremely complex challenge. In this paper, an integrated macro-micro approach is developed to simulate the escape process. An analysis of the simulation reveals the mechanisms of the formation of crowd congestion and flow distribution. At the macroscopic level, a mathematical model, based on the concept of the dynamic user optimal (DUO) criterion, is formulated to describe the pedestrian exit/route choice behavior. A method based on the fundamental diagram and point-queuing theory is developed to estimate the pedestrian escape time. At the microscopic level, a modified social force model is adopted to formulate pedestrians' dynamic movements during the escape process. A solution algorithm is proposed to solve the macro-micro integrated model and a series of experiments are carried out to validate the proposed model. The simulation results agree with the extracted experimental data. Finally, the integrated model and algorithm are used to simulate the escape process in a large public place. The proposed approach is able to generate the bandwagon effect, bottleneck effect, and route choice patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {We report a thorough analysis of the intermittent flow of pedestrians through a narrow door. The observations include five different sets of evacuation drills with which we have investigated the effect of door size and competitiveness on the flow dynamics. Although the outcomes are in general compatible with the existence of the faster-is-slower effect, the temporal evolution of the instantaneous flow rate provides evidence of new features. These stress the crucial role of the number of people performing the tests, which has an influence on the obtained results. Once the transients at the beginning and end of the evacuation are removed, we have found that the time lapses between the passage of two consecutive pedestrians display heavy-tailed distributions in all the scenarios studied. Meanwhile, the distribution of burst sizes decays exponentially; this can be linked to a constant probability of finding a long-lasting clog during the evacuation process. Based on these results, a discussion is presented on the caution that should be exercised when measuring or describing the intermittent flow of pedestrians through narrow doors.},

Instead of just measuring the evacuation times, we have analyzed the probability distribution of the time lapses between consecutive individuals. We show how it displays a power-law tail.

  Abstract                 = {Schooling, an archetype of collective behaviour, emerges from the interactions of fish responding to sensory information mediated by their aqueous environment. A fundamental and largely unexplored question in fish schooling concerns the role of hydrodynamics. Here, we investigate this question by modelling swimmers as vortex dipoles whose interactions are governed by the Biot-Savart law. When we enhance these dipoles with behavioural rules from classical agent-based models, we find that they do not lead robustly to schooling because of flow-mediated interactions. We therefore propose to use swimmers equipped with adaptive decision-making that adjust their gaits through a reinforcement learning algorithm in response to nonlinearly varying hydrodynamic loads. We demonstrate that these swimmers can maintain their relative position within a formation by adapting their strength and school in a variety of prescribed geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, we identify schooling patterns that minimize the individual and collective swimming effort, through an evolutionary optimization. The present work suggests that the adaptive response of individual swimmers to flow-mediated interactions is critical in fish schooling.},

If an alternative, microscopic (e.g. Monte Carlo or Lattice Boltzmann) description of the physics is available, we illustrate how this microscopic simulator can be enabled (through a computational superstructure) to perform certain integration and numerical bifurcation analysis tasks directly at the coarse, systems level. This approach, when successful, can circumvent the derivation of accurate, closed form, macroscopic \{PDE\} descriptions of the system. The direct 'systems level' analysis of microscopic process models, facilitated through such numerical enabling technologies, may, if practical, advance our understanding and use of nonequilibrium systems.},

We present a procedure that, given a process for integrating the system step by step and a set of values of the observables, finds the values of the remaining system variables such that the state is close to the slow manifold to some desired accuracy. It should be noted that this is not equivalent to "integrating down to the manifold" since the latter process may significantly change the values of the observables. We consider problems whose solution has a singular perturbation expansion, although we do not know what it is nor have any way to compute it (because the system is not necessarily expressed in a singular perturbation form). We show in this paper that, under some conditions, computing the values of the remaining variables so that their (m + 1)st time derivatives are zero provides an estimate of the unknown variables that is an mth-order approximation to a point on the slow manifold in a sense to be defined. We then show how this criterion can be applied approximately when the system is defined by a legacy code rather than directly through closed form equations. This procedure can be valuable when one wishes to start a simulation of the detailed model on the slow manifold with particular values of observable variables characterizing the slow manifold.},

  Abstract                 = {It is natural to think that in perceiving dynamic scenes, vision takes a series of snapshots. Motion perception can ensue when the snapshots are different. The snapshot metaphor suggests two questions: (i) How does the visual system put together elements within each snapshot to form objects? This is the spatial grouping problem. (ii) When the snapshots are different, how does the visual system know which element in one snapshot corresponds to which element in the next? This is the temporal grouping problem. The snapshot metaphor is a caricature of the dominant model in the field-the sequential model-according to which spatial and temporal grouping are independent. The model we propose here is an interactive model, according to which the two grouping mechanisms are not separable. Currently, the experiments that support the interactive model are not conclusive because they use stimuli that are excessively specialized. To overcome this weakness, we created a new type of stimulus-spatiotemporal dot lattices-which allow us to independently manipulate the strength of spatial and temporal groupings. For these stimuli, sequential models make one fundamental assumption: if the spatial configuration of the stimulus remains constant, the perception of spatial grouping cannot be affected by manipulations of the temporal configuration of the stimulus. Our data are inconsistent with this assumption.},

Recently, dynamic floor fields were introduced which adapt to changes in geometry and the density of crowds. They significantly increase the realism of floor field-based simulations. However, the computation of floor fields is time consuming. In case of multiple or dynamic floor fields, which require frequent recomputations, the total simulation run time is dominated by their computation. We present an algorithm to construct floor fields for continuous space models that uses unstructured meshes. Due to the geometrical flexibility of unstructured meshes, our method reduces the computational complexity by using fewer but well-positioned mesh points.},

  abstract = {We develop a framework for dimension reduction, mode decomposition, and nonparametric forecasting of data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. This framework is based on a representation of the Koopman group of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of the dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion maps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions through a regularized advection-diffusion operator, and employ these eigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high smoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point spectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group into mutually commuting vector fields, which we reconstruct in data space through a representation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We also use a special property of this basis, namely that the basis elements evolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models for arbitrary probability densities and observables. In systems with more complex spectral behavior, including mixing systems, we develop a method inspired from time change in dynamical systems to transform the generator to a new operator with improved spectral properties, and use that operator for vector field decomposition and nonparametric forecasting.},

At issue is the imposition of unnecessarily narrow norms of sound reasoning that are used to diagnose so-called cognitive illusions and the continuing reliance on vague heuristics that explain everything and nothing. D. Kahneman and A. Tversky (see record 199601780-007) incorrectly asserted that Gigerenzer simply claimed that frequency formats make all cognitive illusions disappear. In contrast, Gigerenzer has proposed and tested models that actually predict when frequency judgments are valid and when they are not. The issue is not whether or not, or how often, cognitive illusions disappear. The focus should be rather the construction of detailed models of cognitive processes that explain when and why they disappear.

Simon's notion of satisficing, the authors have proposed a family of algorithms based on a simple psychological mechanism: one-reason decision making. These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors held a competition between the satisficing "Take The Best" algorithm and various "rational" inference procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that cognitive mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical norms of rational inference.},

  Abstract                 = {Among the many fascinating examples of collective behavior exhibited by animal groups, some species are known to alternate slow group dispersion in space with rapid aggregation phenomena induced by a sudden behavioral shift at the individual level. We study this phenomenon quantitatively in large groups of grazing Merino sheep under controlled experimental conditions. Our analysis reveals strongly intermittent collective dynamics consisting of fast, avalanche-like regrouping events distributed on all experimentally accessible scales. As a proof of principle, we introduce an agent-based model with individual behavioral shifts, which we show to account faithfully for all collective properties observed. This offers, in turn, an insight on the individual stimulus/response functions that can generate such intermittent behavior. In particular, the intensity of sheep allelomimetic behavior plays a key role in the group's ability to increase the per capita grazing surface while minimizing the time needed to regroup into a tightly packed configuration. We conclude that the emergent behavior reported probably arises from the necessity to balance two conflicting imperatives: (i) the exploration of foraging space by individuals and (ii) the protection from predators offered by being part of large, cohesive groups. We discuss our results in the context of the current debate about criticality in biology.},

  Abstract                 = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of coarse-grained, or macroscopic, quantities. The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to describe a number of simple model systems where the coarse-grained or macroscopic behaviour of a system can be explicitly determined from the full, or microscopic, description; and second, to overview some of the emerging algorithmic approaches that have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, macroscopic dynamics. The model problems we describe may be either stochastic or deterministic in both their microscopic and macroscopic behaviour, leading to four possibilities in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions. Model problems are given which illustrate all four situations, and mathematical tools for their study are introduced. These model problems are useful in the evaluation of algorithms. We use specific instances of the model problems to illustrate these algorithms. As the subject of algorithm development and analysis is, in many cases, in its infancy, the primary purpose here is to attempt to unify some of the emerging ideas so that individuals new to the field have a structured access to the literature. Furthermore, by discussing the algorithms in the context of the model problems, a platform for understanding existing algorithms and developing new ones is built.},

Agent-based models (ABMs) describe interactions among individual agents and their environment, and provide a process-oriented alternative to descriptive mathematical models. Recent \{ABMs\} provide compelling accounts of group pattern formation, contagion and cooperation, and can be used to predict, manipulate and improve upon collective behavior. \{ABMs\} overcome an assumption that underlies much of cognitive science -- that the individual is the crucial unit of cognition. The alternative advocated here is that individuals participate in collective organizations that they might not understand or even perceive, and that these organizations affect and are affected by individual behavior.},

In this framework, the paper presents the results of an on field observation of pedestrian behaviour in an urban crowded walkway. The research was aimed at testing the potentially combined effect of ageing and grouping on speed and proxemic behaviour. In particular, we focused on dyads, as the most frequent type of groups in the observed scenario. Results showed that in situation of irregular flows elderly pedestrians walked the 40% slower than adults, due to locomotion skill decline. Dyads walked the 30% slower than singles, due to the need to maintain spatial cohesion to communicate (proxemics). Results contributed to refine the parametric validation of the agent-based simulation system ELIAS38.},

Importantly, however, the route from perception to action is not a one-way street, rather, perception and action interact continuously. In this chapter, we synthesize a bidirectional view on perceptual decision making by discussing behavioral, neuroscientific, and computational findings in the context of one embodiment framework. We conclude that there is evidence for the liaison of action and perception in simple decision-making tasks. This framework may also be extended to reward-based decision making in humans.},

  Abstract                 = {This tutorial is to introduce steering behaviours, a technique for giving moving objects in your game or simulation an amount of autonomy. Path finding through a 2D grid of different ground types is pretty much a solved problem, but to add more realism in games like Dungeon Keeper 2 and ThemePark World, we wanted to allow characters to be involved in crushes at doorways and for them not to walk through each other. After reading a paper written by Craig Reynolds called "Steering Behaviours for Autonomous Characters" we decided to implement and adapt the system to our own needs. Various other people have used the same techniques in their games, including Jim Van Verth and John O'Brien from Red Storm who extended the techniques for formation movement in their strategy tank game "Force 21". The behaviours themselves are simple to code but in combination can produce complex AI, and the resulting techniques can be used in both 2D and 3D with equal success. The discussion below first introduces the system, goes into detail of each behaviour, looks at strategies for combining the behaviours successfully to achieve a desired effect and finally covers some of the difficulties of using steering behaviours in a full production game.},

  abstract = {Agent based pedestrian simulation models can be distinguished by their granularity. Models that consider the simulation environment as a two dimensional continuous space and perform the simulation in small time steps are usually called microscopic, whilemodels that still represent individual persons but rely on a coarser abstraction of the real world or often called mesoscopic. In many situations a mesoscopic representation is to favor over a microscopic one. The obvious reasons are: (i) less data has to be collected and processed in order to setup a simulation scenario and (ii) a mesoscopic simulation model usually is less consuming in terms of computational costs compared to a microscopic model. Nevertheless, there are still situations where a microscopic simulation is needed and wanted. Examples are crossing pedestrian streams, bidirectional flows at high densities, and the simulation of pedestrians with multiple destinations (e.g. pedestrian movement in shopping malls). One approach that takes advantage of both kinds of models is a hybrid combination in which the microscopic model is applied where needed and the mesoscopic model where plausible. This work focuses on the hybrid combination of a mesoscopic queuing model and a microscopic model that is based on considering obstacles in velocity space. An efficient way to represent the simulation environment is discussed and a method that conserves dynamic properties over the boundaries of the hybrid coupling like flow, density, and speed is introduced in detail as well. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is shown based on a hypothetical large-scale scenario.},

  abstract = {We consider a microscopic model (a system of self-propelled particles) to study the behaviour of a large group of pedestrians walking in a corridor. Our point of interest is the effect of anisotropic interactions on the global behaviour of the crowd. The anisotropy we have in mind reflects the fact that people do not perceive (i.e. see, hear, feel or smell) their environment equally well in all directions. The dynamics of the individuals in our model follow from a system of Newton-like equations in the overdamped limit. The instantaneous velocity is modelled in such a way that it accounts for the angle at which an individual perceives another individual. We investigate the effects of this perception anisotropy by means of simulations, very much in the spirit of molecular dynamics. We define a number of characteristic quantifiers (including the polarization index and Morisita index) that serve as measures, for example, for organization and clustering, and we use these indices to investigate the influence of anisotropy on the global behaviour of the crowd. The goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of this model; extensive statistical analysis of simulation data and reproducing any specific real-life situation are beyond its scope.},

  Abstract                 = {Migration of organisms (or cells) is typically an adaptive response to spatiotemporal variation in resources that requires individuals to detect and respond to long-range and noisy environmental gradients. Many organisms, from wildebeest to bacteria, migrate en masse in a process that can involve a vast number of individuals. Despite the ubiquity of collective migration, and the key function it plays in the ecology of many species, it is still unclear what role social interactions play in the evolution of migratory strategies. Here, we explore the evolution of migratory behavior using an individual-based spatially explicit model that incorporates the costs and benefits of obtaining directional cues from the environment and evolvable social interactions among migrating individuals. We demonstrate that collective migratory strategies evolve under a wide range of ecological scenarios, even when social encounters are rare. Although collective migration appears to be a shared navigational process, populations typically consist of small proportions of individuals actively acquiring directional information from their environment, whereas the majorities use a socially facilitated movement behavior. Because many migratory species face severe threat through anthropogenic influences, we also explore the microevolutionary response of migratory strategies to environmental pressures. We predict a gradual decline of migration due to increasing habitat destruction and argue that much greater restoration is required to recover lost behaviors (i.e., a strong hysteresis effect). Our results provide insights into both the proximate and ultimate factors that underlie evolved migratory behavior in nature.},

We conducted an empirical study with human subjects in a complex multi-level building and compared thinking aloud protocols and performance measures of experienced and inexperienced participants in different wayfinding tasks. Three specific strategies for navigation in multi-level buildings were compared. The central point strategy relies on well-known parts of the building; the direction strategy relies on routes that first head towards the horizontal position of the goal, while the floor strategy relies on routes that first head towards the vertical position of the goal. We show that the floor strategy was preferred by experienced participants over the other strategies and was overall tied to better wayfinding performance. Route knowledge showed a greater impact on wayfinding performance compared to survey knowledge. A cognitive-architectural analysis of the building revealed seven possible c auses for navigation problems. Especially the previous termstaircasenext term design was identified as a major wayfinding obstacle. Finally we address the benefits of cognitive approaches for the architectural design process and describe some open issues for further research.},

  abstract = {Introduction
The safety of humans in crowded environments has been recognised as an important and rapidly growing research area with significant implications for urban planning, event management, building design, fire safety engineering and rescue service to name a few. This stream of research is aimed at guiding safe designs and effective evacuation plans by simulating emergency scenarios and estimating measures such as total evacuation time. A large body of research has also been dedicated to the development of modelling tools with the capability to identify (and thus prevent) circumstances that lead to crowd discomfort, crashes or disasters in mass gatherings and public facilities. It has, however, been argued that the empirical knowledge in this area has lagged behind the theoretical developments and computational capabilities. This has left the descriptive power of the existing models for reproducing the natural behaviour of humans questionable given that in many cases there is a lack of reliable and well-conditioned data for model validation or calibration purposes.
Methods
With the vast majority of the empirical knowledge in this fast-growing and interdisciplinary field being very recent, a survey of the existing literature is still missing. Here, we gather together the existing empirical knowledge in this area in a comprehensive review (based on surveying more than 160 studies restricted to those published in peer-reviewed journals since 1995) in order to help bridge this gap. We introduce for the first time a categorisation system of the relevant data collection techniques by recognising seven general empirical approaches. We also differentiate between various aspects of human behaviour pertinent to crowd behaviour by putting them into perspective in terms of three general levels of decision making. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages offered by each data collection technique. Major gaps and poorly-explored topics in the current literature are discussed.
Findings and applications
Our major conclusion is that the empirical evidence in this area is largely disperse and even in some cases mixed and contradictory, requiring a more unified system of terminologies and problem definitions as well as unified measurement methods in order for the findings of different studies to become replicable and comparable. We also showed that the existing body of empirical studies display a clear imbalance in addressing various aspects of human behaviour with certain (but crucial) aspects (such as pre-movement time and choice of activity) being poorly understood (as opposed to our knowledge and amount of data about walking behaviour for example). Our review also revealed that previous studies have predominantly displayed a stronger tendency to study the behaviour based on aggregate measures as opposed to individual-level data collection attempts. We hope that this collection of findings sets clearer avenues for advancing the knowledge in this area, guides future experiment designs and helps researchers form better-informed hypotheses and choose most suitable data collection methods for their question in hand.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedestrian movement models have been developed since the 1970s. A review of the literature shows that such models have been developed to explain and predict macro, meso, and micro movement patterns. However, recent developments in modelling techniques, and especially advances in agent-based simulation, open up the possibility of developing integrative and complex models which use existing models as 'building blocks'. In this paper we describe such integrative, modular approach to simulating pedestrian movement behaviour. The STREETS model, developed by using Swarm and GIS, is an agent-based model that focuses on the simulation of the behavioural aspects of pedestrian movement. The modular structure of the simulation is described in detail. This is followed by a discussion of the lessons learned from the development of STREETS, especially the advantages of adopting a modular approach and other aspects of using the agent-based paradigm for modelling.},

  abstract = {Abstract Stair ascending performance is critical during evacuation from buildings and underground infrastructures. Healthy subjects performed self-paced ascent in three settings: 13 floor building, 31 floor building, 33 m stationary subway escalator. 
To investigate leg muscle and cardiorespiratory capacities and how they constrain performance, oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR) and ascending speed were measured in all three; electromyography (EMG) in the first two. The \{VO2\} and \{HR\} ranged from 89 to 96% of 
the maximum capacity reported in the literature. The average highest \{VO2\} and \{HR\} ranged from 39 to 41 mL kg -1 min -1 and 162 to 174
 b min -1, respectively. The subjects were able to sustain their initial preferred maximum pace for a short duration, while the average step rate was 92 95 steps per min. In average, \{VO2\} reached relatively stable values at bout 37 mL kg -1 min -1 . \{EMG\} amplitudes decreased significantly and frequencies were unchanged. Speed reductions indicate that climbing capacity declined in the process of 
fatigue development. In the two buildings, the reduction of muscle power allowed the subjects to extend their tolerance and complete ascents in the 48 m and 109 m high stairways in 2.9 and 7.8 min, respectively. Muscle activity interpretation squares were developed and 
proved advantageous to observe fatigue and recovery over time.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for studying pedestrians' behavior at pedestrian crossings. To help understand the behavior of pedestrians, separate models were developed and estimated for divided and undivided streets. Estimated models include waiting time at the curbside and the number of crossing attempts needed by the pedestrian to make a successful crossing. From a broad range of road user and roadway factors, the strongest and most significant predictors which influenced the pedestrian's waiting time and the frequency of attempts to cross the streets were gender, age, number of children in household, crossing frequency, number of people in the group attempting to cross, access to private vehicle, destination, home location in relation to pedestrian crossing, and pedestrian past involvement in traffic accidents. In addition to these predictors, maximum likelihood estimates revealed that the pedestrian expected waiting time seems to profoundly influence the number of attempts needed to successfully cross the street (divided or undivided). Furthermore, results relating to pedestrian crossings on divided streets indicate that the pedestrian's expected waiting time when crossing from one side of the street to the central refuge island seem to increase the risk to end the waiting time when crossing from the refuge island to the other side of the street. Finally, results seem to suggest that pedestrians behave differently or have different waiting times as they cross from one side of the street to the refuge and from the refuge to the other side of the street.},

  Abstract                 = {The design of a knee joint is a key issue in robotics and biomechanics to improve the compatibility between prosthesis and human movements, and to improve the bipedal robot performances. We propose a novel design for the knee joint of a planar bipedal robot, based on a four-bar linkage. The dynamic model of the planar bipedal robot is calculated. Two kinds of cyclic walking gaits are considered. The first gait is composed of successive single support phases with stance flat-foot on the ground separated by impacts. The second gait is a succession of finite time double support phases, single support phases, and impacts. During the double support phase, both feet rotate. This phase is ended by an impact of the toe of the forward foot, while the rear foot is taking off. The single support phase is ended by an impact of the swing foot heel, the other foot keeping contact with the ground through its toe. For both gaits, the reference trajectories of the rotational joints are prescribed by cubic spline functions in time. A parametric optimization problem is presented for the determination of the parameters corresponding to the optimal cyclic walking gaits. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a dynamical stable walking gait with double support phases with feet rotation, impacts, and single support phases for this bipedal robot.},

  Abstract                 = {Floor field methods are one of the most popular medium-scale navigation concepts in microscopic pedestrian simulators. Recently introduced dynamic floor field methods have increased the realism, i.e. agreement of spatio-temporal patterns of pedestrian densities in simulations and real world observations, of such simulations significantly. These methods update floor fields continuously taking other pedestrians into account. This implies that computational times are mainly determined by the cal- culation of floor fields. In this work, we propose a new computational approach for the construction of dynamic floor fields. The approach is based on the one hand on adaptive grid concepts and on the other hand on a directed calculation of floor fields, i.e. the calculation is restricted to the domain of interest. Combining both techniques the computational complexity can be reduced by a factor of 10 as demonstrated by several realistic scenarios. Thus on-line simulations are possible for moderate realistic scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {In this contribution, we revisit multiple first order macroscopic modelling approaches to pedestrian flows and computationally compare the results with a microscopic approach to pedestrian dynamics. We find that widely used conservation schemes show significantly different results than microscopic models. Thus, we propose to adopt on a macroscopic level a structured continuum model. The approach basically relies on fundamental diagrams - the relationship between fluxes and local densities - as well as the explicit consideration of individual velocities, thus showing similarities to generalised kinetic models. The macroscopic model is outlined in detail and shows a significantly better agreement with microscopic pedestrian models. The increased realism, important for safety relevant real life applications, is underlined considering several scenarios.},

The cross-cultural generalizability of such motivations was addressed by examining Japanese culture. Anthropological, sociological, and psychological analyses revealed that many elements of Japanese culture are incongruent with such motivations. Moreover, the empirical literature provides scant evidence for a need for positive self-regard among Japanese and indicates that a self-critical focus is more characteristic of Japanese. It is argued that the need for self-regard must be culturally variant because the constructions of self and regard themselves differ across cultures. The need for positive self-regard, as it is currently conceptualized, is not a universal, but rather is rooted in significant aspects of North American culture. Conventional interpretations of positive self-regard are too narrow to encompass the Japanese experience.},

Although these phenomena are often very different from the ones known from equilibrium thermodynamics, their description is mostly possible by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called "phantom traffic jams", although they all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while nervous crowds are "freezing by heating"? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? What consequences does their herding behavior have?},

The differences between these pedestrian specific equations and those for ordinary fluids are worked out, for example concerning the mechanism of relaxation to equilibrium, the role of ``pressure'', the special influence of internal friction and the origin of ``temperature''. Some interesting results are derived that can be compared to real situations, for example the development of walking lanes and of pedestrian jams, the propagation of waves, and the behavior on a dance floor.

This behavior is assumed to be determined by an intended velocity, by several attractive and repulsive effects, and by fluctuations. The movement of pedestrians is dependent on decisions, which have the purpose of optimizing their behavior and can be explicitly modeled. Some interesting applications of the model to real situations are given, especially to formation of groups, behavior in queues, avoidance of collisions, and selection processes among behavioral alternatives.},

  abstract = {Many observations of the dynamics of pedestrian crowds, including various self-organization phenomena, have been successfully described by simple many-particle models. For ethical reasons, however, there is a serious lack of experimental data regarding crowd panic. Therefore, we have analyzed video recordings of the crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah during the Hajj in 1426H on 12 January 2006. They reveal two subsequent, sudden transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and "turbulent" flows, which question many previous simulation models. While the transition from laminar to stop-and-go flows supports a recent model of bottleneck flows [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)], the subsequent transition to turbulent flow is not yet well understood. It is responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden displacements and the falling and trampling of people. The insights of this study into the reasons for critical crowd conditions are important for the organization of safer mass events. In particular, they allow one to understand where and when crowd accidents tend to occur. They have also led to organizational changes, which have ensured a safe Hajj in 1427H.},

If the inflow is below the maximum outflow, we find an asymptotic stationary solution. If the inflow is above this value, we observe queue formation, which can be described by a shock wave equation. We also address the experimental observation of intermittent outflows, taking into account the lack of space in the merging zone by a minimum function and coordination problems by a stochastic variable. This results in avalanches of different sizes even if friction, force networks, inelastic collapse, or delay-induced stop-and-go waves are not assumed. Our intermittent flows result from a random alternation between particle propagation and gap propagation. Erratic flows in congested merging zones of vehicle traffic may be explained in a similar way.},

Here we develop a model of pedestrian motion to explore the evolution of trails in urban green spaces such as parks. Our aim is to address such questions as what the topological structures of these trail systems are, and whether optimal path systems can be predicted for urban planning. We use an 'active walker' model that takes into account pedestrian motion and orientation and the concomitant feedbacks with the surrounding environment. Such models have previously been applied to the study of complex structure formation in physical, chemical and biological systems. We find that our model is able to reproduce many of the observed large-scale spatial features of trail systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Each year, crowd disasters happen in different areas of the world. How and why do
such disasters happen? Are the fatalities caused by relentless behavior of people or a
psychological state of panic that makes the crowd go mad? Or are they a tragic
consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other questions are
addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available videos and materials,
which document the planning and organization of the Love Parade in Duisburg,
Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our analysis reveals a number of
misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also provide a new perspective on
concepts such as intentional pushing, mass panic, stampede, and crowd crushes.
The focus of our analysis is on the contributing causal factors and their mutual
interdependencies, not on legal issues or the judgment of personal or institutional
responsibilities. Video recordings show that people stumbled and piled up due to a
domino effect, resulting from a phenomenon called crowd turbulence or crowd
quake. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be distinguished
from crowd disasters resulting from mass panic or crowd crushes. In Duisburg,
crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying feedback and cascading
effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities. Accordingly, things can go terribly
wrong in spite of no bad intentions from anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg
with others, we give recommendations to help prevent future crowd disasters. In
particular, we introduce a new scale to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd.
This may allow preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss
the merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering that
today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web.},

  abstract = {Many mobility models currently used for evaluating wireless communication systems have weak resemblance to reality
and there is a lack of understanding on which characteristics of human mobility affect system performance. In particular, most current
mobility models assume a free flow of nodes and do not consider how mobility is affected by interactions with other persons and with
the physical environment. They also assume a closed system, not considering the effect of node arrival and departure. The structure
of space in which the mobility occurs is either not considered at all, or only in a limited way. In this work, we address human
pedestrian mobility for evaluation of wireless communication to determine which of the aforementioned aspects need to be captured
and to what level of detail. We focus on opportunistic communication in the form of ad-hoc and delay-tolerant networks. For the
evaluation, we use mobility models from the field of transportation and urban planning that are used for designing and dimensioning
public spaces for comfort and safety of pedestrians in rush hour and emergency evacuation. The models capture micro-mobility of
pedestrians better than most mobility models used in mobile networking since the application domain requires realistic representation
of node interactions with the physical environment and with other nodes. Our results show that the free flow assumption used in most
models does not have a significant performance impact. We also conclude that performance is not very sensitive to accurate
estimation of the probability distributions of mobility parameters such as speed and arrival process. Our results, however, suggest that
it is important to capture the scenario and space in which mobility occurs since these may affect performance significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {Moving animal groups display remarkable feats of coordination. This coordination is largely achieved when individuals adjust their movement in response to their neighbours{\textquoteright} movements and positions. Recent advancements in automated tracking technologies, including computer vision and GPS, now allow researchers to gather large amounts of data on the movements and positions of individuals in groups. Furthermore, analytical techniques from fields such as statistical physics now allow us to identify the precise interaction rules used by animals on the move. These interaction rules differ not only between species, but also between individuals in the same group. These differences have wide-ranging implications, affecting how groups make collective decisions and driving the evolution of collective motion. Here, I describe how trajectory data can be used to infer how animals interact in moving groups. I give examples of the similarities and differences in the spatial and directional organisations of animal groups between species, and discuss the rules that animals use to achieve this organisation. I then explore how groups of the same species can exhibit different structures, and ask whether this results from individuals adapting their interaction rules. I then examine how the interaction rules between individuals in the same groups can also differ, and discuss how this can affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Finally, I suggest areas of future research.},

  abstract = {Collective motion, where large numbers of individuals move synchronously together, is achieved when individuals adopt interaction rules that determine how they respond to their neighbors' movements and positions. These rules determine how group-living animals move, make decisions, and transmit information between individuals. Nonetheless, few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups, and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish. Here, we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki): (i) Attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion, while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor's orientation; (ii) repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed; (iii) although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated, individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor. The last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion, raising new questions about how fish and other animals self-organize on the move.},

  Abstract                 = {Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, commonly called Leviathan is a book written in 1651 by Thomas Hobbes. It is titled after the biblical Leviathan. The book concerns the structure of society, as is evidenced by the full title. In the book, Thomas Hobbes argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Influenced by the English Civil War, Hobbes wrote that chaos or civil war could only be averted by strong central government. He thus denied any right of rebellion toward the social contract, which would be later added by John Locke and conserved by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (However, Hobbes did discuss the possible dissolution of the State. Since the social contract was made to institute a state that would provide for the "peace and defense" of the people, the contract would become void as soon as the government no longer protected its citizens. By virtue of this fact, man would automatically return to the state of nature until a new contract is made). -- Excerpted from Leviathan (book) on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.},

Due to the very nature of fire fighting more complex physiological variables are difficult to measure. We measured metabolic and respiratory responses in 15 male, professional fire fighters during simulated work tasks on a test ground. Work time was on the average 22 min with individual components of work tasks lasting 2 to 4 min. The mean oxygen consumption for the whole exercise (22 min) was 2.75 +- 0.29 l/min. The most demanding work task demanded an oxygen uptake of 3.55 +- 0.27 l/min. Corresponding values for respiratory minute volumes were 82 +- 14 and 102 +-14 l/min, respectively. Heart rates averaged 168 +- 12 for the whole test and 179 +-13 beats/min for the heaviest work task. Two new classes for classification of intensive and exhausting, short term physical work are proposed for inclusion in \{ISO8996\} and values for relevant parameters are proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {To support planning, design, and management of pedestrian infrastructure, dynamic assignment models are useful tools. However, current models are network-based and presume that travelers can choose between a finite number of discrete route alternatives. For walking facilities, where pedestrians can choose their paths freely in two-dimensional space, applicability of these traditional network models is limited. This article puts forward an approach for user-optimal dynamic assignment in continuous time and space. Contrary to network-based approaches, the theory allows the traffic units to choose from an infinite non-countable set of paths through the considered space. The approach consists of three interrelated steps, that is: determining the continuous paths using a path choice model, assigning the origin-destination flows, and calculating the resulting traffic conditions. The approach to determine a user-optimal assignment is heuristic and consists of a sequence of all-or-nothing assignments in continuous time-space. The article presents the mathematical problem formulation, solution approaches, and application examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypic differences of genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions have been attributed to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes. Various mechanisms have been suggested, including the existence of alternative steady states in regulatory networks that are reached by means of stochastic fluctuations, long transient excursions from a stable state to an unstable excited state, and the switching on and off of a reaction network according to the availability of a constituent chemical species. Here we analyse a detailed stochastic kinetic model of two-component system signalling in bacteria, and show that alternative phenotypes emerge in the absence of these features. We perform a bifurcation analysis of deterministic reaction rate equations derived from the model, and find that they cannot reproduce the whole range of qualitative responses to external signals demonstrated by direct stochastic simulations. In particular, the mixed mode, where stochastic switching and a graded response are seen simultaneously, is absent. However, probabilistic and equation-free analyses of the stochastic model that calculate stationary states for the mean of an ensemble of stochastic trajectories reveal that slow transcription of either response regulator or histidine kinase leads to the coexistence of an approximate basal solution and a graded response that combine to produce the mixed mode, thus establishing its essential stochastic nature. The same techniques also show that stochasticity results in the observation of an all-or-none bistable response over a much wider range of external signals than would be expected on deterministic grounds. Thus we demonstrate the application of numerical equation-free methods to a detailed biochemical reaction network model, and show that it can provide new insight into the role of stochasticity in the emergence of phenotypic diversity.},

boundaries is considered as traffic flow model. The large-L approximation of the stationary state is used 
for the derivation of the time-headway distribution (an important microscopic characteristic of traffic 
flow) for the model with generalized update (genTASEP) in both, forward- and backward-sequential 
representations. The usually used updates, fully-parallel and regular forward- and backward-sequential, are analyzed as special cases of the genTASEP. It is shown that only for those cases, the time-headway 
distribution is determined by the flow regardless to the density. The qualitative comparison of the results with traffic data demonstrates that the genTASEP with backward order and attractive interaction 
evinces similar properties of time-headway distribution as the real traffic sample.},

This study aims to incorporate the long-term congestion anticipation and aversion in the pedestrians choice of destinations and routes into \{FFCA\} models. The first contribution of this study is the innovative time-dependent static field, which is represented by a tim-space network. The steps of the proposed methodology include path prediction, congestion identification, and time-dependent travel cost calculation, all of which are demonstrated with several illustrative examples. The local structure of \{FFCA\} and its high efficiency can be maintained, because the proposed extension of \{FFCA\} is focused on calculating the time-dependent static field. Another contribution of this study is that the key parameters, namely, congestion threshold and percentage of congestion-averse pedestrians, are calibrated with actual data. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated with a numerical example, and the results are satisfactory in terms of departure rate.},

The calculation formula for transition probability was given in the model based on floor field, position vacancy degree and group attraction, and the evacuation strategy was presented. Meanwhile, the experiment studied the relationships of evacuation time, mean system velocity as well as pedestrian density. The result showed that the evacuation time could be reduced effectively when the mean system velocity and position vacancy had proper degree, and the bigger group had negative effect with the evacuation time, so the bigger group should be avoided in actual evacuation process.},

Less predictable is the remarkable finding that these coupled, non-linear, time dependent equations are conformally mappable and this finding enables solutions to be obtained easily for both supercritical and subcritical flows.},

  abstract = {The equations of motion governing the two-dimensional flow of pedestrians are derived for flows of both single and multiple pedestrian types. Two regimes of flow, a high-density (subcritical) and a low-density (supercritical) flow regimes, are possible, rather than two flow regimes for each type of pedestrian. A subcritical flow always fills the space available. However, a supercritical flow may either fill the space available or be self-confining for each type of pedestrian, depending on the boundary location. Although, the equations governing these flows are simultaneous, time-dependent, non-linear, partial differential equations, remarkably they may be made conformally mappable. The solution of these equations becomes trivial in many situations. Free streamline calculations, utilizing this property, reveal both upstream and downstream separation of the flow of pedestrians around an obstacle. Such analysis tells much about the nature of the assumptions used in various models for the flow of pedestrians. The present theory is designed for the development of general techniques to understand the motion of large crowds. However, it is also useful as a predictive tool. The behavior predicted by these equations of motion is compared with aerial observations for the Jamarat Bridge near Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that, for this important case, pedestrians, that is pilgrims, aim at achieving each immediate goal in minimum time rather than achieving all goals in overall minimum time. Typical of many examples, this case illustrated the strong dependence of path on the psychological state of the pedestrians involved. It is proposed that the flow of pedestrians over the Jamarat Bridge be improved by appropriate barrier placement, that force an effective global view of the goals.},

  abstract = {Contexts that elicit bipedalism in extant apes may provide evidence of the selective pressures that led to hominid bipedalism. Bipedalism was observed most commonly among chimpanzees when they fed on the small fruits of diminutive, open-forest trees. Chimpanzees fed bipedally from such trees either by reaching up to pick fruit while standing on the ground, or from within the tree, in which case bipedalism was frequently stabilized by grasping an overhead branch. The food-gathering function of chimpanzee bipedalism suggests that hominid bipedalism may have evolved in conjunction with arm-hanging as a specialized feeding adaptation that allowed for efficient harvesting of fruits among open-forest or woodland trees. Such evidence is particularly valuable when it is in accord with fossil anatomy. Australopithecus afarensis has features of the hand, shoulder and torso that have been related to arm-hanging in chimpanzees. The australopithecine hip and hind limb clearly indicate bipedalism, but also indicate a less than optimal adaptation to bipedal locomotion compared to modern humans. Locomotor inefficiency supports the hypothesis that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking adaptation. A bipedal postural feeding adaptation may have been a preadaptation for the fully realized locomotor bipedalism apparent in Homo erectus.},

  abstract = {Abstract The characteristics of pedestrian movement down stairs from high-rise building influence the total evacuation time, the formation of congestion and even the safety of evacuees. In this paper two different experimental scenarios, which could be regarded as the phased evacuation and total evacuation respectively, were conducted on stairs in a high-rise building to investigate the evacuation process and pedestrian movement characteristics down stairs. The evacuation processes were recorded by video cameras, and the movement parameters were extracted from the video data. In experimental scenario one and two, the space-time distribution, the speed of participants walking through two adjacent floors and specific flow for participants through different stair landings were analyzed and discussed. Then, the fundamental diagrams for pedestrians in the two different evacuation scenarios were presented followed by the analysis of the influences of merging flow on pedestrian movement. It is found that the longer time intervals between participants occur because of the bottlenecks caused by slow movement individuals in experimental scenario one. In experimental scenario two, it is found that participants who stand in front of the queue accelerate just before the merging with participants coming from upstairs. Moreover, from the analysis of the fundamental diagram, we find that the merging flow influences pedestrians movement down stairs, and the detailed egress facilities and evacuation processes should be taken into account when the functions of SFPE Handbook are used to predict the evacuation variables. It is also found that the speeds of participants from upstairs are reduced by the entry of participants from the corresponding floors during the merging time period.},

  abstract = {The Centre for Adaptive Behaviour and Cognition (ABC) has hypothesised that much human decision-making can be described by simple algorithmic process models (heuristics). This paper explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of Take The Best for choosing between two alternatives: cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC's theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modelling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behaviour but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb.},

We searched for the behaviour patterns of the individual fish, which allow movement of such a school. On the basis of biological facts we constructed a number of behaviour models and tested them with computer simulations against biological reality. Basic assumptions of our simulations are: (1) The motion of a fish is only influenced by the position and orientation of its nearest neighbours. (2) The new velocity and the turning angle of each fish (after a time step) are calculated by probability distributions taking into account random influences. (3) The movement of each model fish is based upon the same behaviour model, i.e. the modelled fish group swims without a leader. The basic behaviour patterns are attraction, repulsion and parallel orientation. Our investigations show that it is very important how a fish mixes the influences of its neighbours. If a fish averages the influences of its neighbours, the model fish group shows the typical characteristics of a real fish school: strong cohesion and high degree of polarization. If a fish only responds to a single neighbour, the model creates a confused fish group.},

Data were collected from police and demonstrators regarding the same crowd events at the EU summit in Gothenburg in 2001. Five types of crowd events, three of which turned violent, are analysed. A theory about interactive aggravation and mitigation processes (AM model) was evolved. The model illuminates the different views of the police and the demonstrators. It particularly depicts three critical interactive processes, categorising, organising and mutual treatment, the extreme positions of which may be either aggravation (escalating conflicts and leading to riots) or mitigation (de-escalating conflicts and leading to peaceful demonstrations). It is further proposed that contextual factors such as type of demonstration and type of demonstrators significantly influence the way the police react to different types of crowds. The result supports the Elaborated Social Identity Model as proposed by Reicher and colleagues and the AM model is discussed with reference to that tradition.},

  Abstract                 = {It is difficult to identify a target in the peripheral visual field when it is flanked by distractors. In the present study, we investigated this "crowding" effect for biological motion stimuli. Three walking biological motion stimuli were presented horizontally in the periphery with various distances between them, and observers reported the walking direction of the central figure. When the inter-walker distance was small, discriminating the direction became difficult. Moreover, the reported direction for the central target was not simply noisier, but reflected a degree of pooling of the three directions from the target and two flankers. However, when the two flanking distractors were scrambled walking biological motion stimuli, crowding was not seen. This result suggests that the crowding of biological motion stimuli occurs at a high-level of motion perception.},

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

These social interactions are often thought to reduce risk from predators, despite a lack of direct evidence. We investigated risk-related selection for collective motion by allowing real predators (bluegill sunfish) to hunt mobile virtual prey. By fusing simulated and real animal behavior, we isolated predator effects while controlling for confounding factors. Prey with a tendency to be attracted toward, and to align direction of travel with, near neighbors tended to form mobile coordinated groups and were rarely attacked. These results demonstrate that collective motion could evolve as a response to predation, without prey being able to detect and respond to predators.},

In some cases, we added capabilities that did not exist before. In other cases, we found anomalous behaviors and adjusted the existing code to remove these unexplained behaviors. This paper summarizes the work on the verification tests, highlighting the lessons learned and modifications made. We also discuss some modifications we recommend to the NIST verification tests, as well as demonstrate how to make these tests suitable for all pedestrian flow models (not just building fire evacuation).},

The ACM were tested in two case studies conducted in Ueno Park (Tokyo). The first case study is focused on the visualization of the intensity of activity in the totality of the park. The second case study is focused in two sub-places of the park, generating representations of people's personal spaces combined into a three-dimensional Common social space. The research concludes with the analysis of the generated visualizations and their potential for incorporating place-variables into the digital design process.},

  abstract = {Abstract The time required to board an airplane directly influences an airplanes turn-around time, i.e., the time that the airplane requires at the gate between two flights. Thus, the turn-around time can be reduced by using efficient boarding methods and such actions may also result in cost savings. The main contribution of this paper is fourfold. First, we provide a general problem description including partly established and partly new definitions of relevant terms. Next, we survey boarding methods known from theory and practice and provide an according classification scheme. Third, we present a broad overview on the current literature in this field and we describe 12 most relevant papers in detail and juxtapose their results. Fourth, we summarize the state-of-the-art of research in this field showing e.g., that the commonly used strategy back-to-front generally requires more time than other easy to implement strategies such as random boarding. Further concepts and approaches that can help speed up the boarding process are also presented and these can be studied in future research.},

In this paper, we focus on the fundamental diagram, and on the relation between the instantaneous velocity and spatial headway (distance to the predecessor). While the latter was found to be linear in previous experiments, we show that it is rather a piecewise linear behavior which is found if larger density ranges are covered. Indeed, our data clearly exhibits three distinct regimes in the behavior of pedestrians that follow each other. The transitions between these regimes occur at spatial headways of about 1.1 and 3 m, respectively. This finding could be useful for future modeling.},

Properties of pedestrians walking in line: Fundamental diagrams - Notes

I. INTRODUCTION

- Pedestrians change velocity and direction.
- Experiment was done on circular path.
- Trajectories of pedestrians were reconstructed in three dimensions.
- Instantaneous fundamental diagram = relation between instantaneous velocity of pedestrian and his instantaneous density
 -> instantaneous density d = inverse of his spatial headway h, e.g. h = 0.5 m => d = 1 / 0.5 = 2 ped / m
- v(h) -> velocity depends on headway (step length)
 -> Two transitions occurred during experiment: at 1.1 m and at 3 m
 -> It is a piecewise linear relation.
 
II. THE EXPERIMENT

- Goal: characterize one-dimensional pedestrian traffic at various densities.
 -> Vary density: either use more pedestrians or modify path.
- Setup
 * 28 people (20 male, 8 female)
 * Path was limited by two walls: one with radius 2 m and one with radius 4.5 m
 => Two trajectories: one at 2.4 m and one at 4.1 m => Distance travelled: 15.08 m and 25.76 m respectively => People either run on inner or outer circle in a line w/o passing each other
 * Density varied between 0.31 to 1.86 ped/m
- Experiment was tracked by a VICON MX-40 motion capture system.

III. FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM

- Key result is fundamental diagram (density vs. velocity graph).
 -> High density => low velocity
- Fundamental diagram at global or local scope.
 * Global: velocities and densities are averaged over the whole system and whole duration.
 * Local: velocities and densities are measured over a finite time period.
- Another fundamental diagram is instantaneous measurement: distance between two pedestrians is interpreted as the inverse of a density.
 -> Distance between two pedestrians = 0.5 m => 1 ped / 0.5 m => 2 ped / 1 m
- Calculations:
 * Global density p = N [ped] / 2*pi*R [m]
 * Local velocity v = x [m] / t_entry - t_exit
 -> x is a small fraction of the circle DELTA Phi
 * Instantaneous diagram:
 -> instantaneous velocity is used -> "spatial headway" (= distance to predecessor) is used => inverse is interpreted as density => These values are averaged over 60 consecutive time frames (complete time: 0.5 s) and produce one data point
- Among different replicas, the dispersion is stronger for lower densities.
 -> Reasoning: at lower densities, test person has more choice to vary velocity and different test persons where involved during different replicas.
- Observations from experiments:
 * Stop-and-go waves are formed at high densities.
 * Velocity does not vanish but rather reaches a limiting value at high densities.
 
IV. PHASE TRANSITIONS IN THE FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR

- Three "regimes" were detected:
 * Free: spatial headway is greater than 3 m (pedestrians walk with their preferred velocity but adaption time for this is at 13.7 s)
 * Weakly constrained: between 1.1 and 3 m (velocity is weakly inferred, adaption time is 5.32 s)
 * Strongly constrained: below 1.1 (adaption time is 0.74 s)
 => Almost linear behavior in each regime
 => Adaption decreases when spatial headway decreases (because of imminent collisions)
 => Maybe, adaption time depends on culture (French < German; Germans need a lot of space before moving)
 
V. CONCLUSION

- Fundamental diagram to describe pedestrian movements.
- Three regimes. Crossovers between them is quite sharp.
- Instead of changing velocity continuously, adaption time takes only three discrete values.

  abstract = {In human crowds, interactions among individuals give rise to a variety of self-organized collective motions that help the group to effectively solve the problem of coordination. However, it is still not known exactly how humans adjust their behavior locally, nor what are the direct consequences on the emergent organization. One of the underlying mechanisms of adjusting individual motions is the stepping dynamics. In this paper, we present first quantitative analysis on the stepping behavior in a one-dimensional pedestrian flow studied under controlled laboratory conditions. We find that the step length is proportional to the velocity of the pedestrian, and is directly related to the space available in front of him, while the variations of the step duration are much smaller. This is in contrast with locomotion studies performed on isolated pedestrians and shows that the local density has a direct influence on the stepping characteristics. Furthermore, we study the phenomena of synchronization-walking in lock step-and show its dependence on flow densities. We show that the synchronization of steps is particularly important at high densities, which has direct impact on the studies of optimizing pedestrians' flow in congested situations. However, small synchronization and antisynchronization effects are found also at very low densities, for which no steric constraints exist between successive pedestrians, showing the natural tendency to synchronize according to perceived visual signals.},

Properties of pedestrians walking in line. II. Stepping behavior - Notes

I. INTRODUCTION

- Behavior of a single pedestrian influences the complete group.
- Research question: how do people behave in large densities?
- In real life, two-dimensional problem (pedestrians move longitudinal and angular).
 -> Simplification: just use longitudinal movement and use a straight corridor with periodic boundary conditions at start and end.

 Start End
 
- Paper focuses on stepping behavior in one-dimensional experiment.
- Key results:
 * Size of steps is directly related to space in front of pedestrian.
 * Step frequency is far less sensitive to local density.
 * Synchronisation between pedestrians occur in high AND low density situations.
- Idea: motivate synchronisation by using music.

II. EXPERIMENT

- Experiment focuses on stepping behavior in various dynamic regimes, e.g. free flow and jams.
- Setup:
 * Circular path
 * Inner wall with radius 2 m
 * Outer wall with radius 4.5 m
 * 28 test persons (20 male, 8 female)
- Observed behavior:
 * Two trajectories: one with radius 2.4 m and the other with 4.1 m
 * Average global density varied from 0.31 to 1.86 ped / m

III. STEP MEASUREMENTS

- In previous paper, oscillations of trajectories were filtered.
 -> Now these oscillations are evaluated, i.e. why are there any oscillations?
- Body of pedestrian sways when walking.
- Information for step length, step duration and synchronisation could be extracted.

IV. STEPPING LAWS

- Different plots:
 * instantaneous velocity vs. length of steps
 -> It is proportional.
 * instantaneous velocity vs. duration of steps
 -> It is proportional.
 * instantaneous density vs. length of steps
 -> Length of steps decreases if density increases.
 * instantaneous density vs. duration of steps
 -> Duration increases if density increases.
- Immam's law (step length = sqrt(v)) contradicts observations.
- In experiment, pedestrians rather adapt their velocity by changing step length than step frequency.
 -> Valid for inner and outer circle => it is independent of geometry.
- Density plots are identical to previous paper.
- Duration of step only varies a little bit around a lower boundary => Too small durations are uncomfortable for pedestrians.

V. STEP SYNCHRONIZATION

- At high densities, pedestrians squeeze front foot into hole made by front foot of predecessor (phenomena is called "lock step").
- Plot radii of pedestrian's trajectory over time:
 * Oscillations were observed => shorter and longer paths are walked.
 * Pedestrians are synchronised if plots are equal.
 * Plots of two pedestrians next to each other are analysed if there plots are almost equal.
 -> There is a phase shift.
- It is still an open question to which signals pedestrians are most sensitive.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

- Step length is proportional to velocity.
- Duration of steps only varies very little.
- In contrast to hypothesis, pedestrians use very little steps instead of waiting and making a big one.
- Results differ from experiments with isolated pedestrians.
- At high densities, pedestrians synchronize their steps using "lock step".
- Also at low densities pedestrians tend to synchronize their steps.
- Music improves synchronisation. A simple metronome is worse.
- Further experiments with music and metronome are necessary.

In this paper, we propose some moving rules for modeling the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians. The modified visual angle car-following model is presented for the movement of vehicles with consideration of the lateral effect of waiting pedestrians. The pedestrians' behavior is summarized as consisting of three steps: pedestrian arrival, gap acceptance, and pedestrian crossing. Some characteristic parameters of pedestrians are introduced to characterize pedestrians' behavior. Simulation results show that the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians lowers the traffic capacity and increases delays to both vehicles and pedestrians.},

There is a large variety in flow and speed as functions of density for empirical data of pedestrian streams obtained from studies in different countries. The net-time headway, however, stays approximately constant over all these different data sets. By using this fact, we demonstrate how the underlying dynamics of pedestrian crowds, naturally follows from local interactions. This means that there is no need to come up with an arbitrary fit function (with arbitrary fit parameters) as has traditionally been done. Further, by using not only the average density values but the variance as well, we show how the recently reported stop-and-go waves [ Helbing et al. Phys. Rev. E 75 046109 (2007)] emerge when local density variations take values exceeding a certain maximum global (average) density, which makes pedestrians stop.},

  abstract = {Microscopic simulation of pedestrian traffic is an important and increasingly popular method to evaluate the performance of existing or proposed infrastructure. The social force model is a common model in simulations, describing the dynamics of pedestrian crowds given the goals of the simulated pedestrians encoded as their preferred velocities. The main focus of the literature has so far been how to choose the preferred velocities to produce realistic dynamic route choices for pedestrians moving through congested infrastructure. However, limited attention has been given the problem of choosing the preferred velocity to produce other behaviors, such as waiting, commonly occurring at, e.g., public transport interchange stations. We hypothesize that: (1) the inclusion of waiting pedestrians in a simulated scenario will significantly affect the level of service for passing pedestrians, and (2) the details of the waiting model affect the predicted level of service, that is, it is important to choose an appropriate model of waiting. We show that the treatment of waiting pedestrians have a significant impact on simulations of pedestrian traffic. We do this by introducing a series of extensions to the social force model to produce waiting behavior, and provide predictions of the model extensions that highlight their differences. We also present a sensitivity analysis and provide sufficient criteria for stability.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in evacuation simulations. These interactive computer based tools have been developed to help the owners and designers of large public buildings to assess the risks that occupants might face during emergency egress. The development of the Glasgow Evacuation Simulator is used to illustrate the existing generation of tools. This system uses Monte Carlo techniques to control individual and group movements during an evacuation. The end-user can interactively open and block emergency exits at any point. It is also possible to alter the priorities that individuals associate with particular exit routes. A final benefit is that the tool can derive evacuation simulations directly from existing architects models; this reduces the cost of simulations and creates a more prominent role for these tools in the iterative development of large-scale public buildings. Empirical studies have been used to validate the GES system as a tool to support evacuation training. The development of these tools has been informed by numerous human factors studies and by recent accident investigations. For example, the 2003 fire in the Station nightclub in Rhode Island illustrated the way in which most building occupants retrace their steps to an entrance even when there are alternate fire exits. The second half of this paper uses this introduction to criticise the existing state of the art in evacuation simulations. These criticisms are based on a detailed study of the recent findings from the 9/11 Commission (2004). Ten different lessons are identified. Some relate to the need to better understand the role of building management and security systems in controlling egress from public buildings. Others relate to the human factors involved in coordinating distributed groups of emergency personnel who may be physically exhausted by the demands of an evacuation. Arguably the most important findings centre on the need to model the ingress and egress of emergency personnel from these structures. The previous focus of nearly all-existing simulation tools has been on the evacuation of building occupants rather than on the safety of first responders1.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25-50:1, and to 100-200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

We examined for the first time large-scale movement patterns of a solitary-ranging and small-brained mammal, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), by using the change-point test and a heuristic random travel model to get insight into foraging strategies and potential route-planning abilities. Mouse lemurs are small nocturnal primates inhabiting the seasonal dry deciduous forest in Madagascar. During the lean season with limited food availability, these lemurs rely on few stationary food resources. We radio-tracked seven lemurs and analysed their foraging patterns. First change-points coincided with out-of-sight keystone food resources. Travel paths were more efficient in detecting these resources than a heuristic random travel model within limits of estimated detection distance. Findings suggest that even nocturnal, solitary-ranging mammals with small brains plan their route to an out-of-sight target.

  Abstract                 = {In natural behavior, fixation patterns are tightly linked to the ongoing task. However, a critical problem for task-driven systems is dealing with unexpected stimuli. We studied the effect of unexpected potential collisions with pedestrians on the distribution of gaze of subjects walking in a virtual environment. Pedestrians on a collision course with the subject were surprisingly ineffective in evoking fixations, especially when subjects were additionally occupied with another task, suggesting that potential collisions do not automatically attract attention. However, prior fixations on pedestrians did increase collision detection performance. Additionally, the detection of potential collisions led to a short-term change in the strategy of looking at subsequent pedestrians. The overall pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that subjects typically rely on mechanisms that are initiated top-down to detect unexpected events such as potential collisions. For this to be effective, subjects must learn an appropriate schedule for initiating search through experience with the probabilities of environmental events.},

  Abstract                 = {The social force model of Helbing and Moln\'ar is one of the best known approaches to simulate pedestrian motion, a collective phenomenon with nonlinear dynamics. It is based on the idea that the Newtonian laws of motion mostly carry over to pedestrian motion so that human trajectories can be computed by solving a set of ordinary differential equations for velocity and acceleration. The beauty and simplicity of this ansatz are strong reasons for its wide spread. However, the numerical implementation is not without pitfalls. Oscillations, collisions, and instabilities occur even for very small step sizes. Classic solution ideas from molecular dynamics do not apply to the problem because the system is not Hamiltonian despite its source of inspiration. Looking at the model through the eyes of a mathematician, however, we realize that the right hand side of the differential equation is nondifferentiable and even discontinuous at critical locations. This produces undesirable behavior in the exact solution and, at best, severe loss of accuracy in efficient numerical schemes even in short range simulations. We suggest a very simple mollified version of the social force model that conserves the desired dynamic properties of the original many-body system but elegantly and cost efficiently resolves several of the issues concerning stability and numerical resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {There are many well validated models of pedestrian movement on a flat
surface. This is not the case for movement on stairs. Experiments show that pedestrians
slow down when climbing or descending stairs. Hence, it is tempting to model
movement on stairs by simply slowing down by a factor. But this would imply that,
other than being slower, motion on stairs mirrors motion in the plane. Is that assumption
justified? We conduct field observations that reveal similarities but also
significant differences. Thus we argue that modeling movement on stairs by slowing
down free-flow velocities may be an acceptable first shot. True microscopic
behavior, however, like treading from step to step and keeping to a straight line instead
of trying to overtake can only be captured by a dedicated model. We present
an extension to the Optimal Steps Model that achieves this.},

evacuation. The Social Distances Model (SDM) is designed for efficient modeling of pedestrian dynamics. This
Cellular Automata (CA) based model, when implemented on the most modern GPUs, can simulate up to 106--108
entities. However, a valuable simulation of pedestrian evacuation must include various factors that govern pedestrian
movement, e.g., information provided by event organizers and navigation or allocation of other pedestrians. The most
common method for introducing such information into simulations is the application of different floor fields. The
floor fields provide 'local knowledge' that affects pedestrians by modifying of the transition functions of an applied
cellular automaton. The main disadvantage of this method is its time consuming updating process. We propose GPU
based calculation of static and dynamic floor fields, whereby simulations that use several different floor fields can
be efficiently calculated. A single GPU is able to cope with SDM calculations while other GPUs updates dynamic
floor fields constantly or when required. We also present the classic approach to performing CA based simulations on
systems with multiple processing units. The lattice is simply partitioned between the available GPUs. We compare
these two approaches in terms of performance and functionality.},

All modes of transport have to be granted their very own right of way. Stakeholders of particular modes, tourists and commuters, old and young have their own needs and ideas and they all demand to be involved in the planning process of transport projects without having to dig into the words and numbers produced by traffic engineers. Microsimulation is a tool which accommodates both: the requirements that are set by the complexity of such projects, as well as the needs to produce easy-to-understand information and communication material. This paper demonstrates the capability of microsimulation through a French case study, including the planning and design of transport schemes for a busy city centre and urban area where all modes of transport are being used and there is a strong focus of public attention.},

As our primary example, we mainly focus on a microscopic spin-flip model for the adsorption and desorption of molecules between a surface adjacent to a gas phase, although a similar analysis carries over to other processes. The new model can capture large scale structures, while retaining microscopic information on intermolecular forces and particle fluctuations. The requirement of detailed balance is utilized as a systematic design principle to guarantee correct noise fluctuations for the coarse-grained model. We carry out a rigorous asymptotic analysis of the new system using techniques from large deviations and present detailed numerical comparisons of coarse-grained and microscopic Monte Carlo simulations. The coarse-grained stochastic algorithms provide large computational savings without increasing programming complexity or the CPU time per executed event compared to microscopic Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Determining individual-level interactions that govern highly coordinated motion in animal groups or cellular aggregates has been a long-standing challenge, central to understanding the mechanisms and evolution of collective behavior. Numerous models have been proposed, many of which display realistic-looking dynamics, but nonetheless rely on untested assumptions about how individuals integrate information to guide movement. Here we infer behavioral rules directly from experimental data. We begin by analyzing trajectories of golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) swimming in two-fish and three-fish shoals to map the mean effective forces as a function of fish positions and velocities. Speeding and turning responses are dynamically modulated and clearly delineated. Speed regulation is a dominant component of how fish interact, and changes in speed are transmitted to those both behind and ahead. Alignment emerges from attraction and repulsion, and fish tend to copy directional changes made by those ahead. We find no evidence for explicit matching of body orientation. By comparing data from two-fish and three-fish shoals, we challenge the standard assumption, ubiquitous in physics-inspired models of collective behavior, that individual motion results from averaging responses to each neighbor considered separately; three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to fish dynamics. However, pairwise interactions qualitatively capture the correct spatial interaction structure in small groups, and this structure persists in larger groups of 10 and 30 fish. The interactions revealed here may help account for the rapid changes in speed and direction that enable real animal groups to stay cohesive and amplify important social information.},

  abstract = {Three experimental studies of interdependent escape, based on a laboratory simulation of one type of panic situation, have been reported. Each collection of subjects was given a limited amount of time to escape from an imminent danger, but they were able to escape only one at a time. The major findings from the experiments are: 1. (1) As threatened penalty for failure to escape increases, the percentage of persons who succeed in doing so declines. 2. (2) As size of the collection increases, the percentage escaping declines. This may also be stated as an increase in the time required per escape with increasing size. There remains considerable ambiguity about the shape of this function. 3. (3) If members of the collection are oriented toward taking their behavioral cues from each other, as compared with an orientation toward making their behavioral decisions independently of one another, the effect upon escape may be either a deleterious one (When at the outset there is generally little optimism about escape) or a salutary one (when the general level of initial optimism is high.) 4. (4) The availability of a distinctive response for the public expression of confidence greatly increases the percentage of persons who succeed in escaping. The results are taken as indicating the fruitfulness of analyzing the interdependent escape situation in terms of present-day concepts and principles of social influence.},

on an observation principle, i.e. pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed
environment and are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit
analysis function. The influences of the different strategies on the evacuation time, the
individual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution, and the overall jam size itself are
investigated. The response of the system to broken escape routes is also analyzed. A
good and plausible dynamic response in the route choice behavior of the pedestrians is
achieved.},

Examples include multi-purpose arenas, large railway stations and airports. In this dissertation the use of modern parallel hardware in combination with optimised algorithms are for the first time used on site to speed up the simulation of large crowds. The aim is to perform real-time forecasts of pedestrian traffic. For this purpose, special neighbourhood lists and a two-stage hybrid parallelisation are used. The second part of this dissertation deals with route choice in complex structures, which plays an important role in achieving realistic computer simulations of pedestrian flows. The developed route choice process is based on visibility and perception of the local environment by the simulated agents. It has as basis a navigation graph. The generation of the graph, especially in complex structures, has also been performed within the framework of this thesis. The work is closed with an empirical study in which the route choice profiles of spectators during various football games and concert performances are analysed and compared with the proposed model. The runtime optimisation strategies and route choice algorithms have been successfully tested in the ESPRIT arena in D\"usseldorf (Germany), where they have been integrated in an evacuation assistant.},

  Abstract                 = {Equation-free modeling is a collective term referring to a paradigm for multiscale computation and computer-aided analysis. It is designed for a class of complex/multiscale problems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic, coarse scale of interest, while accurate models are only given at a more detailed (fine-scale, microscopic, possibly atomistic) level of description. The framework enables one to perform macroscopic computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and length scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of explicit macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form - hence the term equation-free.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space--the space in which the task is originally described--rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

The results of the experiment were verified by comparing them with video observation data and theoretical values. Finally, with comparative analysis of experiment data, the developed simulation model was able to replicate the situation in which pedestrians find an available booth to occupy while waiting in a queue. The model can facilitate the availability of various pedestrian flows and a range of operating times. With some efforts of computer programming, the situations where multiple booths are available were simulated to identify pedestrian movement. The developed simulation model captures important details, such as travel time, wait time, queue length and the number of waiting pedestrians with the different number of pedestrian flows and booths. The paper presents a means to designing the pedestrian operation and plan on the basis of the estimated number of people.},

  Abstract                 = {Evacuation from a smoke filled tunnel requires quick decision-making and swift action from the tunnel occupants. Technical installations such as emergency signage aim to guide tunnel occupants to the closest emergency exits. However, conflicting information may come from the behavior of other tunnel occupants. We examined if and how conflicting social information may affect evacuation in terms of delayed and/or inadequate evacuation decisions and behaviors. To this end, forty participants were repeatedly situated in a virtual reality smoke filled tunnel with an emergency exit visible to one side of the participants. Four social influence conditions were realized. In the control condition participants were alone in the tunnel, while in the other three experimental conditions a virtual agent (VA) was present. In the no-conflict condition, the VA moved to the emergency exit. In the active conflict condition, the VA moved in the opposite direction of the emergency exit. In the passive conflict condition, the VA stayed passive. Participants were less likely to move to the emergency exit in the conflict conditions compared to the no-conflict condition. Pre-movement and movement times in the passive conflict condition were significantly delayed compared to all other conditions. Participants moved the longest distances in the passive conflict condition. These results support the hypothesis that social influence affects evacuation behavior, especially passive behavior of others can thwart an evacuation to safety.},

  Abstract                 = {Risk perception (RP) is studied in many research disciplines (e.g., safety engineering, psychology, and sociology). Definitions of RP can be broadly divided into expectancy-value and risk-as-feeling approaches. In the present review, RP is seen as the personalization of the risk related to a current event, such as an ongoing fire emergency; it is influenced by emotions and prone to cognitive biases. We differentiate RP from other related concepts (e.g., situation awareness) and introduce theoretical frameworks relevant to RP in fire evacuation (e.g., Protective Action Decision Model and Heuristic-Systematic approaches). Furthermore, we review studies on RP during evacuation with a focus on the World Trade Center evacuation on September 11, 2001 and present factors modulating RP as well as the relation between perceived risk and protective actions. We summarize the factors that influence perception risk and discuss the direction of these relationships (i.e., positive or negative influence, or inconsequential) and conclude with presenting limitations of this review and an outlook on future research.},

  abstract = {Animals living in groups will profit most from sociality if they coordinate the timing and nature of their activities. Self-organizing mechanisms can underlie coordination in large animal groups such as insect colonies or fish schools, but to what degree these mechanisms operate in socially complex species that live in small stable groups is not well known. We therefore examined the collective departure of wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, from their sleeping sites. First, in line with previous observations, the departure process appeared to be coordinated through the cue of individuals 'moving off', with no role for specific vocal or visual signalling. Second, we employed network analyses to explore how interindividual relationships influenced departure patterns, and found that a local rule, to follow the movements of those baboons with whom they shared a close social affiliation, determined when the baboon group departed. Finally, using an agent-based model, we were able to simulate mathematically the observed patterns of collective movements based upon the emergent rule that we identified. Our study adds weight to the idea that social complexity does not necessitate cognitive complexity in the decision-making process, consistent with heuristic decision-making perspectives studied by cognitive psychologists and researchers studying self-organization in biological systems.},

Then a particle occupies more than one cell which leads to subtle effects in the dynamics, e.g. non-local conflict situations. Results from computer simulations of the floor field model are compared with empirical findings. Furthermore, the influence of increasing the maximal walking speed v max is investigated by increasing the interaction range beyond nearest neighbour interactions. The extension of the model to v max >1 turns out to be a severe challenge which can be solved in different ways. Four major variants are discussed that take into account different dynamical aspects. The variation of v max has a strong influence on the shape of the flow--density relation. We show that walking speeds v max >1 lead to results which are in very good agreement with empirical data.},

In this paper a simple CA-model for the description of crowd motion is presented and its implementation in a simulation software outlined. The validity of the assumptions and the scope of the applications will have to be scrutinised by comparison with empirical data from actual evacuations or drills.},

  abstract  = {Whenever there are crowded spaces, queuing occurs. Many different situations force people to queue: Waiting for a service counter, lining up for a train or bus, queuing in front of bottlenecks or simply waiting at a supermarket checkout. Such queuing evolves in many different ways, depending on the situation, the reason for queuing, the culture, the geometry and many more. Simulation models have to cope with such different situations and behaviours. This paper gives an overview on different queuing situations and corresponding models that exist for pedestrian modelling. Additionally, it introduces a new queuing model for organised queuing without demarcation tapes. First visual validations are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis introduces new methods for modelling human wayfinding behavior in the context of microscopic pedestrian simulation models. The basis forms a navigation graph, which is automatically derived from the underlying geometry of a scenario. Applying a cone-based search method, the resulting graph is on the one hand as sparse as possible and on the other hand detailed enough to be able to serve as a wayfinding basis. It is used to combine the microscopic simulation model with a macroscopic dy- namic network model in terms of a control cycle. As a result, the gap between the evacuation times computed by both models is reduced: The coupled model considers both optimized routing strategies and microscopic effects. To model human wayfinding behavior, cognitive processes are considered. The- se processes are translated into wayfinding algorithms, which are based on the derived navigation graph. Different levels of familiarity of a place as well as the distinction between everyday life and evacuation situations are considered by de- fining different metrics on the graph. These algorithms are validated by an experiment performed at Technische Uni- versit\"{a}t M\"{u}nchen. To compare real-world data to the results of the algorithms, a new metric "similarity" is introduced. This metric allows meaningful compari- sons between simulation data and experimental data. The results showed a good match between the real world data and the algorithms. This leads to the con- clusion that human wayfinding does not only rely on one specific criteria, but is influenced by different factors. The usage of sparse navigation graphs enables a combination between macrosco- pic network flow models and microscopic models to derive more realistic evacua- tion times. The incorporation of cognitive processes led to the realistic modelling of human wayfinding behavior.},

  abstract = {One of the most important aspects for a realistic prediction of pedestrian flows is the modelling of human navigation in normal situations such as early design phases of buildings or transportation systems and hubs as well as in evacuation studies to enhance safety in existing infrastructures. To overcome the limitations of current navigation models, this paper proposes a new hybrid multi-scale model, which closely links information between the small-scale and large-scale navigation layer to improve the navigational behaviour. In the presented hybrid navigation model, graph-based methods using visibility graphs are used to model large-scale wayfinding decisions. The pedestrians' movements between two nodes of the navigation graph are modelled by means of a dynamic navigation field. The navigation field is updated dynamically during the runtime of the simulation, explicitly considering other pedestrians for determining the fastest path. The proposed hybrid approach provides a realistic modelling of human navigational behaviour and thus a realistic prediction of flows since it reflects the human cognitive processes triggered by wayfinding tasks. This includes taking into account other pedestrians for routing decisions who are visible from the current position of the considered pedestrian. The paper discusses the concept and the technical details of the proposed hybrid multi-scale approach in detail and presents an extensive case study demonstrating its advantages.},

This study was designed to evaluate one explanation for this effect, the restricted awareness explanation. We hypothesized that as environmental bombardment increases, people become less aware of peripheral objects and happenings in their immediate surroundings. This characteristic may be part of a general adjustment to high-input levels, which may also include an increase in walking speed and a decrease in visual scanning of the environment. The results confirmed each of these expectations. During periods of high traffic noise and density, in contrast to low periods, pedestrians were found to be less aware of novel objects placed along their route, to walk faster, and to engage more in a straight-ahead gaze fixation.},

we performed an empirical study with pupils. Several evacuation runs with groups of
different sizes and different interactions were performed. New group parameters are
introduced which allow to describe the dynamics of the groups and the configuration of
the group members quantitatively. The analysis shows a possible decrease of evacuation
times for large groups due to self-ordering effects. Social groups can be approximated as
ellipses that orientate along their direction of motion. Furthermore, explicitly cooperative
behaviour among group members leads to a stronger aggregation of group members and
an intermittent way of evacuation.},

The distribution of horizontal walking speeds exhibits a maximum between 0.4 and 0.5 m/s, depending on the local density. To underline the need to measure walking speeds on long stairways if one wants to predict travelling times on long stairways, these results are compared to a second study of walking speeds on a short stair. The main result of that measurement is, that some people actually accelerate when walking upward a short stairway, while such a phenomenon could neither be observed for downward motion on the short stairway nor for upward motion on the long stairway. The mean upward walking speed on the short stairway was found to be roughly twice as large as the one on the long stairway, which corresponds to the data found in the literature. Both studies were done by digitally filming the walking persons and evaluating the resulting material frame by frame for the walking times. Together the results suggest, that the speed on stairs does not only vary greatly depending on the length of the stairway, but also that there is no common scaling factor for the speed on stairs in dependence of the length of the stairway for the whole population. This has consequences, e.g. for the construction of simulation models.},

  Abstract                 = {In this contribution Strasbourgs plan pieton will briefly be summarized and as a part of it the traffic situation around the central bridge Pont Kuss will be introduced. At Pont Kuss a number of safety and convenience issues in pedestrian traffic are reported. This is the motivation for a multi-modal microscopic simulation project which assesses measures to improve the situation for pedestrians. The assessment includes both: benefits for pedestrian and potential drawbacks for vehicular traffic. It will be shown in detail that clear benefits for pedestrians and for public transport are opposed by only small - if at all - drawbacks for vehicular traffic. It is concluded that multi-modal micro-simulation is a powerful tool to handle all traffic modes with equal care and equal rights in the planning process and that it is at the same time a powerful tool to produce material for communication with the public.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the development of an ascending evacuation model based on physical work capacity of a selected sample. 
The model is based on the combination of several field experiments, existing databases and pre-tests that were combined to define initial test conditions in the 
laboratory environment on a step machine. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) of 13 male and 12 female subjects (data was pooled), was measured, and they climbed at 
3 step rates specified according to individual percentage of their maximal aerobic capacity (%VO2max) levels. The first nineteen subjects were used for model development and the last six for validation. The paper gives an overview on the collected laboratory data and puts it into relation with the field data from both oxygen consumption 
and heart rate perspective. The maximum vertical displacement (hvert in m/min) can be calculated according to: hvert = - 21.7727 + 0.4024 * \{VO2max\} + 0.2658 * %VO2max. The discussion covers limitations and possibilities of the model and suggests the literature and databases that form the basis for practical use of the prediction model. Paper defines the needs for future work and possible information sources to improve the model.},

  Abstract                 = {Collective intelligence refers to the ability of groups to outperform individual decision makers when solving complex cognitive problems. Despite its potential to revolutionize decision making in a wide range of domains, including medical, economic, and political decision making, at present, little is known about the conditions underlying collective intelligence in real-world contexts. We here focus on two key areas of medical diagnostics, breast and skin cancer detection. Using a simulation study that draws on large real-world datasets, involving more than 140 doctors making more than 20,000 diagnoses, we investigate when combining the independent judgments of multiple doctors outperforms the best doctor in a group. We find that similarity in diagnostic accuracy is a key condition for collective intelligence: Aggregating the independent judgments of doctors outperforms the best doctor in a group whenever the diagnostic accuracy of doctors is relatively similar, but not when doctors' diagnostic accuracy differs too much. This intriguingly simple result is highly robust and holds across different group sizes, performance levels of the best doctor, and collective intelligence rules. The enabling role of similarity, in turn, is explained by its systematic effects on the number of correct and incorrect decisions of the best doctor that are overruled by the collective. By identifying a key factor underlying collective intelligence in two important real-world contexts, our findings pave the way for innovative and more effective approaches to complex real-world decision making, and to the scientific analyses of those approaches.},

  abstract  = {Transport simulation models exist on multiple scales from evacuation simulations of nightclubs
with a few hundred guests over the simulation of transport hubs such as large train stations up to
evacuation simulations of megapolis in case of tsunamis. Depending on precision and complexity
requirements, continuous (e.g. force-based, velocity obstacle based), spatiotemporal discrete (e.g.
cellular automata), or queue models are applied. In general, the finer the spatiotemporal resolution
the more precise the interactions between travelers (e.g. pedestrians or vehicles) are captured, but
the computational burden increases. The obvious approach to achieve higher computational speeds
is to reduce the physical complexity (e.g. by using a queue model), which in turn also reduces the
precision. One way to increase the computational speed while staying precise enough to make
reliable prognosis is to combine models of different scale in a hybrid manner, where a finer model
is applied where needed and a coarser model where plausible. This contribution discusses an
application of a hybrid simulation approach in the context of a large-scale multi- and inter-modal
evacuation scenario. The presented case study investigates the feasibility of an evacuation of parts
of the city of Hamburg in Germany in case of a storm surge.},

  abstract  = {Agent based pedestrian simulation models can be distinguished by their granularity. Models that consider the simulation environment as a two dimensional continuous space and perform the simulation in small time steps are usually called microscopic, while models that still represent individual persons but rely on a coarser abstraction of the real world or often called mesoscopic. Macroscopic models only use densities or groups of persons. In many situations a coarse representation is to favor over a finer one because (i) less data has to be collected and processed in order to setup a simulation scenario and (ii) a coarser simulation model usually is less consuming in terms of computational costs compared to a coarser model. Nevertheless, there are still situations where a microscopic simulation is needed and wanted. Examples are crossing pedestrian streams, bidirectional flows at high densities, and the simulation of pedestrians with multiple destinations (e.g. pedestrian movement in shopping malls). One approach that takes advantage of both kinds of models is a hybrid combination in which a microscopic model is applied where needed and a mesoscopic model where plausible. When coupling different models one requirement is that dynamic properties like flow, density and speed are conserved over the models' boundaries. This work focuses on the hybrid combination of a mesoscopic queuing model and a microscopic model that is based on considering obstacles in velocity space. The main contribution of this work is a method for a hybrid coupling that guaranties dynamic properties like flow, density and speed are conserved over the models' boundaries. Furthermore, an efficient way to represent the simulation environment and retrieve dynamic information is discussed. The performance of the proposed model is shown based on a hypothetical large-scale scenario.},

As the human driver recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be 'shorter' than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an effective dimension $$ , which is a significant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that traffic strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution of vehicular flows over the roads obeys a power law, indicating a clear hierarchical order of the roads. Studying the cellular structure of the areas enclosed by the roads, the distribution of cell sizes is scale invariant as well.},

  abstract = {Queues involve waiting, to be sure, but one's attitudes toward queues may be influenced more strongly by other factors. For instance, customers may become infuriated if they experience social injustice, defined as violation of first in, first out. Queueing environment and feedback regarding the likely magnitude of the delay can also influence customer attitudes and ultimately, in many instances, a firm's market share. Even if we focus on the wait itself, the "outcome" of the queueing experience may vary nonlinearly with the delay, thus reducing the importance of average time in queue, the traditional measure of queueing performance. This speculative paper uses personal experiences, published and unpublished cases, and occasionally "the literature" to begin to organize our thoughts on the important attributes of queueing. To flesh out more of these issues, the author asks for your cards and letters.},

  abstract = {Many witnesses attest that victims of a disaster often perish because they freeze in the face of danger. It has been proposed that this cognitive paralysis occurs due to temporal and cognitive constraints on survival response times while leaving open the question of which cognitive component is implicated in this behavior. This paper proposes, firstly, that the temporal constraints which occur during an emergency inhibit the functioning of the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which leads to the victim showing: 1) an appropriate response, if trained; 2) stereotypical or otherwise irrational behavior, if untrained; or 3) cognitive paralysis. Secondly, that the main role of the SAS is to operate as a temporal buffer, enabling a survival response to be prepared prior to facing a life-threatening event and not as a real-time immediate responder. It is argued that the initial cognitive paralysis differs at the cognitive and neurological levels from the more prolonged hypoactive behavior commonly seen in victims rescued from disasters and which is considered to be a form of disassociative reaction.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory is presented of how a driver might visually control his braking. A mathematical analysis of the changing optic array at the driver's eye indicates that the simplest type of visual information, which would be sufficient for controlling braking and would also be likely to be easily picked up by the driver, is information about time-to-collision, rather than information about distance, speed, or acceleration/deceleration. It is shown how the driver could, in principle, use visual information about time-to-collision in registering when he is on a collision course, in judging when to start braking, and in controlling his ongoing braking. Implications of the theory for safe speeds and safe following distances are discussed, taking into account visual angular velocity detection thresholds, and some suggestions are made as to how safety on the roads might be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {In computational mechanics, molecular dynamics (MD) and finite element (FE) analysis are well developed and most popular on nanoscale and macroscale analysis, respectively. MD can very well simulate the atomistic behavior, but cannot simulate macroscale length and time due to computational limits. FE can very well simulate continuum mechanics (CM) problems, but has the limitation of the lack of atomistic level degrees of freedom. Multiscale modeling is an expedient methodology with a potential to connect different levels of modeling such as quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and continuum mechanics. This study proposes a new multiscale modeling technique to couple MD with FE. The proposed method relies on weighted average momentum principle. A wave propagation example has been used to illustrate the challenges in coupling MD with FE and to verify the proposed technique. Furthermore, 2-Dimensional problem has also been used to demonstrate how this method would translate into real world applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals are capable of enhanced decision making through cooperation, whereby accurate decisions can occur quickly through decentralized consensus. These interactions often depend upon reliable social cues, which can result in highly coordinated activities in uncertain environments. Yet information within a crowd may be lost in translation, generating confusion and enhancing individual risk. As quantitative data detailing animal social interactions accumulate, the mechanisms enabling individuals to rapidly and accurately process competing social cues remain unresolved. Here, we model how motion-guided attention influences the exchange of visual information during social navigation. We also compare the performance of this mechanism to the hypothesis that robust social coordination requires individuals to numerically limit their attention to a set of n-nearest neighbours. While we find that such numerically limited attention does not generate robust social navigation across ecological contexts, several notable qualities arise from selective attention to motion cues. First, individuals can instantly become a local information hub when startled into action, without requiring changes in neighbour attention level. Second, individuals can circumvent speed{\textendash}accuracy trade-offs by tuning their motion thresholds. In turn, these properties enable groups to collectively dampen or amplify social information. Lastly, the minority required to sway a group{\textquoteright}s short-term directional decisions can change substantially with social context. Our findings suggest that motion-guided attention is a fundamental and efficient mechanism underlying collaborative decision making during social navigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Reconstruction is a key step of the motion capture process. The quality of motion data first results from the quality of raw data. However, it also depends on the motion reconstruction step, especially when raw data suffer markers losses or noise due, for example, to challenging conditions of capture. Labeling is a final and crucial data reconstruction step that enables practical use of motion data (e.g., analysis). The lower the data quality, the more time consuming and tedious the labeling step, because human intervention cannot be avoided: he has to manually indicate markers label each time a loss of the marker in time occurs. In the context of crowd study, we faced such situation when we performed experiments on the locomotion of groups of people. Data reconstruction poses several problems such as markers labeling, interpolation and mean position computation. While Vicon IQ software has difficulties to automatically label markers for the crowd experiment we carried out, we propose a specific method to label our data and estimate participants mean positions with incomplete data.},

Overall, pace of life was fastest in Japan and the countries of Western Europe and was slowest in economically undeveloped countries. The pace was significantly faster in colder climates, economically productive countries, and in individualistic cultures. Faster places also tended to have higher rates of death from coronary heart disease, higher smoking rates, and greater subjective well-being. Discussion focuses on how the pace of life is intertwined with the social-psychological and community characteristics of a culture, and the central role of pace of life in defining the personality of a place and its people.},

  abstract  = {Recent developments in multiscale computation allow the solution of ``coarse equations'' for the expected macroscopic behavior of microscopically/stochastically evolving particle distributions without ever obtaining these coarse equations in closed form. The closure is obtained ``on demand'' through appropriately initialized bursts of microscopic simulation. The effective coupling of microscopic simulators with macrosocopic behavior embodied in this approach requires certain decisions about the nature of the unavailable ``coarse equation''. Such decisions include (a) the determination of the highest spatial derivative active in the equation, (b) whether the coarse equation satisfies certain conservation laws, and (c) whether the coarse dynamics is Hamiltonian. These decisions affect the number and type of boundary conditions as well as the nature of the algorithms employed in good solution practice. In the absence of an explicit formula for the temporal derivative, we propose, implement and validate a simple scheme for deciding these and other similar questions about the coarse equation using only the microscopic simulator. Microscopic simulations under periodic boundary conditions are carried out for appropriately chosen families of random initial conditions; evaluating the sample variance of certain statistics over the simulation ensemble allows us to infer the highest order of spatial derivatives active in the coarse equation. In the same spirit we show how to determine whether a certain coarse conservation law exists or not, and we discuss plausibility tests for the existence of a coarse Hamiltonian or integrability. We argue that such schemes constitute an important part of the equation-free approach to multiscale computation.},

  Abstract                 = {Nanometre-scale contact experiments and simulations demonstrate the potential to probe incipient plasticity - the onset of permanent deformation - in crystals. Such studies also point to the need for an understanding of the mechanisms governing defect nucleation in a broad range of fields and applications. Here we present a fundamental framework for describing incipient plasticity that combines results of atomistic and finite-element modelling, theoretical concepts of structural stability at finite strain, and experimental analysis. We quantify two key features of the nucleation and subsequent evolution of defects. A position-sensitive criterion based on elastic stability determines the location and character of homogeneously nucleated defects. We validate this stability criterion at both the atomistic and the continuum levels. We then propose a detailed interpretation of the experimentally observed sequence of displacement bursts to elucidate the role of secondary defect sources operating locally at stress levels considerably smaller than the ideal strength required for homogeneous nucleation. These findings provide a self-consistent explanation of the discontinuous elastic-plastic response in nanoindentation measurements, and a guide to fundamental studies across many disciplines that seek to quantify and predict the initiation and early stages of plasticity.},

  abstract      = {Few studies have focused on the evacuation of multi-floor classroom buildings in a primary school, a process that differs from evacuations in other buildings. A stair-unit model was proposed to describe the spatial topology of twisting stairwells and to describe the spatial relationship between stairwells and floors. Based on the stair-unit model, a schedule-line model was proposed to calculate evacuation paths in stair-units; a modified algorithm to calculate pedestrian forces were proposed to describe the evacuee movements in stairwells; and a projection strategy was proposed to model the 3-dimensional evacuation process in multi-floor buildings. The simulated processes were compared with a real evacuation drill. The results showed that the simulated process achieved qualitative and quantitative consistencies with the real drill, proving the appropriateness of the proposed models and algorithms. Based on the validation, further simulations were conducted and a few rules for evacuations in stairwells were identified including rules governing the impact of the moment of entering a staircase, the number of students in a class, the stagger strategy, and the layout of grades on different floors on the time in stairwell and the total evacuation duration. The results can be used to mitigate the effects of a fire disaster, and the proposed models and algorithms can also be referenced by evacuation simulation for other multi-floor buildings such as residential buildings.},

  abstract = {Abstract Psychology tells us that the different level of tension may lead to different behavior variation for individuals. In this paper, an extended cost potential field cellular automaton is proposed to simulate pedestrian counter flow under an emergency by considering behavior variation of pedestrian induced by psychological tension. A quantitative formula is introduced to describe behavioral changes caused by psychological tension, which also leads to the increasing cost of discomfort. The numerical simulations are performed under the periodic boundary condition and show that the presented model can capture some essential features of pedestrian counter flow, such as lane formation and segregation phenomenon for normal condition. Furthermore, an interesting feature is found that when pedestrians are in an extremely nervous state, a stable lane formation will be broken by a disordered mixture flow. The psychological nervousness under an emergency is not always negative to moving efficiency and a moderate level of tension will delay the occurrence of jamming phase. In addition, a larger asymmetrical ratio of left walkers to right walkers will improve the critical density related to the jamming phase and retard the occurrence of completely jammed phase. These findings will be helpful in pedestrian control and management under an emergency.},

  abstract = {Abstract Merging flows involve complex interactions between pedestrians, which will restrict the efficiency of the evacuation process in emergency situations, such as fires. However, experimental research on merging behavior is limited. This paper describes pedestrian behavior in a merging channel where the branch flow joins the main flow at a junction area. The width of the main channel was fixed at 3.2m while the branch had a changeable value of 0.8m, 1.6m and 2.4m, respectively. Up to 295 university students took part in the experiments and all trajectories were extracted using the mean-shift algorithm. Lane formation was found downstream in the main channel and the increasing amplitude of the lane width formed by the branch flow became weaker with the increasing width of the branch channel. The saturated flow was approximately 4.9ped/s (1.5ped/m/s) and when the branch channel was 2.4m, the main and branch channel became mutual bottlenecks to each other. Moreover, microscopic characteristics of pedestrian interaction were analyzed. Velocity-position relationships with the 1.6m and 2.4m branch widths showed the velocity in the main channel decreased when pedestrians got close to the merging area and the velocity in the branch channel was suppressed significantly compared to that with the 0.8m branch. Density in the corner increased when the branch width increased and reached about 6ped/m2 when the branch width was 2.4m. What's more, pedestrian flow in the branch became jammed in this situation. The results can be used to calibrate pedestrian simulation models and improve public infrastructure design.},

  abstract = {A series of accidents caused by crowds within the last decades evoked a lot of scientific interest in modeling the movement of pedestrian crowds. Based on the discrete element method, a granular dynamic model, in which the human body is simplified as a self-driven sphere, is proposed to simulate the characteristics of crowd flow through an exit. In this model, the repulsive force among people is considered to have an anisotropic feature, and the physical contact force due to body deformation is quantified by the Hertz contact model. The movement of the human body is simulated by applying the second Newton's law. The crowd flow through an exit at different desired velocities is studied and simulation results indicated that crowd flow exhibits three distinct states, i.e., smooth state, transition state and phase separation state. In the simulation, the clogging phenomenon occurs more easily when the desired velocity is high and the exit may as a result be totally blocked at a desired velocity of 1.6 m/s or above, leading to faster-to-frozen effect.},

  abstract = {Crowd force by the pushing or crushing of people has resulted in a number of accidents in recent decades. The aftermath investigations have shown that the physical interaction of a highly competitive crowd could produce dangerous pressure up to 4500 N/m, which leads to compressive asphyxia or even death. In this paper, a numerical model based on discrete element method (DEM) as referenced from granular flow was proposed to model the evacuation process of a group of highly competitive people, in which the movement of people follows Newton's second law and the body deformation due to compression follows Hertz contact model. The study shows that the clogs occur periodically and flow rate fluctuates greatly if all people strive to pass through a narrow exit at high enough desired velocity. Two types of contact forces acting on people are studied. The first one, i.e., vector contact force, accounts for the movement of the people following Newton's second law. The second one, i.e., scale contact force, accounts for the physical deformation of the human body following the contact law. Simulation shows that the forces chain in crowd flow is turbulent and fragile. A few narrow zones with intense forces are observed in the force field, which is similar to the strain localization observed in granular flow. The force acting on a person could be as high as 4500 N due to force localization, which may be the root cause of compressive asphyxia of people in many crowd incidents.},

  abstract = {Guaranteeing a safe, efficient, and comfortable traveling system for pedestrians is one of the most important aspects of an intelligent transportation system. The microscopic simulation of pedestrian flow has attracted increasing research attention in recent years since a reliable simulation model for pedestrian flow may greatly benefit engineers and operators in mass transportation management, as well as designers and planners in urban planning and architecture. This paper introduces CityFlow, an agent-based microscopic pedestrian flow simulation model. The building floor plan in the model is represented by a continuous space constructed in a network approach, and each pedestrian is regarded as a self-adapted agent. Agent movement is implemented in a utility maximization approach by considering various human behaviors. The influences of parameters in the model on the simulation results are investigated. Typical pedestrian flow phenomena, including the unidirectional and bidirectional flow in a corridor as well as the flow through bottlenecks, are simulated. The simulation results are further compared with empirical study results. The comparison reveals that the model can approach the density-speed fundamental diagrams and the empirical flow rates at bottlenecks within acceptable system dimensions. The simulation results of the bidirectional pedestrian flow also show that the model can reproduce the lane-formation phenomenon.},
  comment  = {<note author=gk> A relatively simple grid-free model which is an alternative to the OSM. Utiltiy maximaization approach that uses weights on "influences" that all resemble older ideas. Not really very different from our superpostion of "potentials". Artifical short steps of lenght delta t x desired velocity. Incorporates fundamental diagrams directly by assigning the values of the Weidmann diagram to the desired speed. Agents are simple and movement can be understood. Agent aspects restricted to movement. No attempt to do any sort of psychology or perception beyond a restricted view range. Performs OK on typical validation tests. Parameter choice for tests remain hidden. Unclear whether new calibration is necessary for each test. Paramter studies for some cases which is applaudable. However, other "behaviours" set to zero for parameter studies so intedependency not investigated. Good overview of present state of the art that unfortunately ignores our work. </note>},

Coordinate transformation from local coordinate system of M3D to global coordinate system is implemented by using measurements of the mobile force plate. A stick-chain model was built to visually analyze three-dimensional human gait and joint trajectories, and triaxial joint moments during gait can be calculated.},

  abstract = {Abstract Pedestrian inflow process frequently occurs in various pedestrian facilities in our daily life. Great importance should be attached to the study of this process. In this paper, we explore the pedestrian inflow process in a room with a separate entrance and exit. Two kinds of experiments are conducted: experiment 1 has no inactive persons and primarily focuses on analyzing the features of the normal pedestrian inflow process and analyzing the representative spatial parameters in the steady state, while experiment 2 involves the influence of the inactive persons. In order to quantitatively discuss the distribution of pedestrians in the steady state, we adopt several analytical methods, such as the Voronoi diagram method, proxemics, and point pattern analysis. Some features of the inflow process are captured. The distribution of pedestrians in the steady state is not uniform. The proxemics and attraction to the exit are both considered to affect pedestrians distribution in the inflow process. The presence of inactive persons may have an impact on both the inflow and outflow processes. Practical suggestions are provided for the managers of pedestrian facilities.},

  abstract = {Abstract Pedestrian inflow is frequently observed in various pedestrian facilities. In this work, we first proposed four hypotheses concerning the inflow process. Then, we performed a series of experiments to test the hypotheses. With several analytical methods, e.g., the proxemics theory and Voronoi diagram method, the features of pedestrian inflow are analyzed in detail. Results demonstrate that the distribution of pedestrians in the room is not uniform. Boundaries are attractive for these pedestrians. The impact of two factors of the inflow are analyzed, i.e., movement rule, and first-out reward. It is found pedestrians can enter the room more effectively under the random rule or two queues. Under some hurry circumstances, pedestrians may prefer to gather around the door, and the spatial distribution is not uniform, leading to the imbalance use of the room. Practical suggestions are given for pedestrians to improve the travel efficiency in the inflow process. This experimental study is meaningful to reveal some fundamental phenomena of inflow process, which can provide the realistic basis for building the theory and mathematical-physical models.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantitative description of a complex system is inherently limited by our ability to estimate the system's internal state from experimentally accessible outputs. Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system's state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system's complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems.},

The proposed model is a probabilistic exit choice model that allows understanding the heterogeneity of the different decision maker's tastes. A stated preference survey was designed and realized with a sample of decision makers in order to achieve this objective. Thus, the obtained data was used to model the optimal mixed logit model. The use of DCMs allows to know the behaviour of different decision maker types during an evacuation process. The case study highlights the importance of the influence of other decision makers on the decision-making process.

Moreover, it allows comparing different model specifications or the parameters of the same model estimated using different data collection techniques, e.g. virtual reality experiment, real data, etc. The methodology is here implemented using navigation data collected in a Virtual Reality tunnel evacuation experiment including 96 participants. A trajectory dataset in the proximity of an emergency exit is used to test and compare different metrics, i.e. Euclidean and modified Euclidean distance, for the static floor field. In the present case study, modified Euclidean metrics provide better fitting with the data. A new formulation using random parameters for pedestrian cellular automaton models is also defined and tested.},

In this article, the authors focus on crowd simulations based on CA and agent-based modeling approaches. Basic technical aspects of large-scale crowd simulations are presented: specifically proposed architecture, our view on synchronization patterns, as well as hierarchy of objects in logic and data layer. A new method of agent conflict resolution is also proposed. Such an approach was successfully applied in the Allianz Arena stadium model, and other large-scale simulations developed by the authors.

  Abstract                 = {Verification and validation (V&V) of pedestrian dynamics models have
become a subject of extensive discussions over the last few years. While
some requirements and tests are proper for all models, simultaneously
each type of model requires also its own set of specific tests. In models
based on Cellular Automata (CA) discretization of space and time is
the main source of possible errors. This paper addresses some issues,
that should be carefully investigated in order to obtain a final, reliable
model.
The negative effects of discretization are discussed, as well as, the
problem of maintaining pedestrian speed in different grid configurations
i.e. movement isotropy. In parallel we show that wall penetration can
occur in CA models and that input geometry has to be validated. The
issue of automatic detection of collective effects in CA-based models is
mentioned. Finally, the necessity of fundamental diagram application in
validation is broadly discussed.
The aim of this paper is to bring the CA-based pedestrian dynamics
models into current general discussion about V&V and to indicate
specific issues of CA-based models.},

  abstract = {Modeling pedestrian movement is an interesting problem both in statistical physics and in computational physics. Update schemes of cellular automaton (CA) models for pedestrian dynamics govern the schedule of pedestrian movement. Usually, different update schemes make the models behave in different ways, which should be carefully recalibrated. Thus, in this paper, we investigated the influence of four different update schemes, namely parallel/synchronous scheme, random scheme, order-sequential scheme and shuffled scheme, on pedestrian dynamics. The multi-velocity floor field cellular automaton (FFCA) considering the changes of pedestrians? moving properties along walking paths and heterogeneity of pedestrians? walking abilities was used. As for parallel scheme only, the collisions detection and resolution should be considered, resulting in a great difference from any other update schemes. For pedestrian evacuation, the evacuation time is enlarged, and the difference in pedestrians? walking abilities is better reflected, under parallel scheme. In face of a bottleneck, for example a exit, using a parallel scheme leads to a longer congestion period and a more dispersive density distribution. The exit flow and the space?time distribution of density and velocity have significant discrepancies under four different update schemes when we simulate pedestrian flow with high desired velocity. Update schemes may have no influence on pedestrians in simulation to create tendency to follow others, but sequential and shuffled update scheme may enhance the effect of pedestrians? familiarity with environments.},

  abstract    = {Financial markets (share markets, foreign exchange markets and others) are all characterized by a number of universal power laws. The most prominent example is the ubiquitous finding of a robust, approximately cubic power law characterizing the distribution of large returns. A similarly robust feature is long-range dependence in volatility (i.e., hyperbolic decline of its autocorrelation function). The recent literature adds temporal scaling of trading volume and multi-scaling of higher moments of returns. Increasing awareness of these properties has recently spurred attempts at theoretical explanations of the emergence of these key characteristics form the market process. In principle, different types of dynamic processes could be responsible for these power-laws. Examples to be found in the economics literature include multiplicative stochastic processes as well as dynamic processes with multiple equilibria. Though both types of dynamics are characterized by intermittent behavior which occasionally generates large bursts of activity, they can be based on fundamentally different perceptions of the trading process. The present chapter reviews both the analytical background of the power laws emerging from the above data generating mechanism as well as pertinent models proposed in the economics literature.},

asymmetric group interactions. Such pairs consist of a leader, who mainly determines
the couple s motion and a follower, who has a defined tendency to follow the
leader. Examples for such pairs are mother and child or two siblings of different age.
We examine the system properties and compare them to the case of a homogeneous
crowd. We find a strong impact on evacuation times for the regime of strong pair
coupling due to the occurrence of a clogging phenomenon. In addition we obtain a
non-trivial dependence of evacuation times on the followers coupling to the static
floor field, which carries the information of the shortest way to the exit location. In
particular we find that systems with fully passive followers, who are solely coupled
to their leaders, show lower evacuation times than homogeneous systems where all
pedestrians have an equal tendency to move towards the exit.We compare the results
of computer simulations with recently performed experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a novel approach for simulating pedestrian movement behavior based on artificial intelligence technology. Within this approach, a large volume of microscopic pedestrian movement behavior types were collected and encapsulated into an artificial neural network via network training. The trained network was then fed back into a simulation environment to predict the pedestrian movement. Two simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the approach. First, a pedestrian-collision-avoidance test was conducted, and the results showed that virtual pedestrians with learned pedestrian behavior can move reasonably to avoid potential collisions with other pedestrians. In addition, a critical parameter, i.e., defined as reacting distance and determined to be 2.5 m, represented the boundary of the collision buffer zone. Second, a pedestrian counterflow in a road-crossing situation was simulated, and the results were compared with the real-life scenario. The comparison revealed that the pedestrian distributions, erratic trajectories, and density-speed fundamental diagram in the simulation are reasonably consistent with the real-life scenario. Furthermore, a quantitative indicator, i.e., the relative distance error, was calculated to evaluate the simulation error of pedestrians trajectories between the simulation and the real-life scenario, the mean of which was calculated to be 0.322. This revealed that the simulation results were acceptable from an engineering perspective, and they also showed that the approach could reproduce the lane-formation phenomenon. We considered the proposed approach to be capable of simulating human-like microscopic pedestrian flow.},

A stair-unit model was proposed to describe the spatial topology of twisting stairwells and to describe the spatial relationship between stairwells and floors. Based on the stair-unit model, a schedule-line model was proposed to calculate evacuation paths in stair-units; a modified algorithm to calculate pedestrian forces were proposed to describe the evacuee movements in stairwells; and a projection strategy was proposed to model the 3-dimensional evacuation process in multi-floor buildings. The simulated processes were compared with a real evacuation drill. The results showed that the simulated process achieved qualitative and quantitative consistencies with the real drill, proving the appropriateness of the proposed models and algorithms. Based on the validation, further simulations were conducted and a few rules for evacuations in stairwells were identified including rules governing the impact of the moment of entering a staircase, the number of students in a class, the stagger strategy, and the layout of grades on different floors on the time in stairwell and the total evacuation duration. The results can be used to mitigate the effects of a fire disaster, and the proposed models and algorithms can also be referenced by evacuation simulation for other multi-floor buildings such as residential buildings.},

  Abstract                 = {On its opening day, the London Millennium Bridge (LMB) experienced unexpected large amplitude lateral vibrations due to crowd loading. This form of pedestrian--structure interaction has since been identified on several other bridges of various structural forms. The mechanism has generally been attributed to 'pedestrian synchronous lateral excitation' or 'pedestrian lock-in'. However, some of the more recent site measurements have shown a lack of evidence of pedestrian synchronization, at least at the onset of the behaviour. This paper considers a simple model of human balance from the biomechanics field--the inverted pendulum model--for which the most effective means of lateral stabilization is by the control of the position, rather than the timing, of foot placement. The same balance strategy as for normal walking on a stationary surface is applied to walking on a laterally oscillating bridge. As a result, without altering their pacing frequency, averaged over a large number of cycles, the pedestrian effectively acts as a negative (or positive) damper to the bridge motion, which may be at a different frequency. This is in agreement with the empirical model developed by Arup from the measurements on the LMB, leading to divergent amplitude vibrations above a critical number of pedestrians.},

The value of business enterprise is expressed in the activities of professional speculators and queue counters. Queue jumping is discouraged by a number of contraints, but, if social pressure fails, physical force is seldom used to eject the intruder. Principles of queue etiquette are illustrated with empirical and anecdotal evidence from the study of Australian football queues.},

operator. We develop a framework where we first approximate
the Koopman operator by computing the kernel
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) operator for different
flow regimes using fully observed training data. We then
pose flow completion as a least squares problem constrained
by the one step evolution of the kernel DMD operator. We
present numerical experiments with simulated pedestrian

  Abstract                 = {First, we give a rigorous convergence result for equation-free analysis in the setting of slow-fast systems using implicit lifting. Second, we apply this result to study the idealized traffic modeling problem of phantom jams generated by cars with uniform behavior on a circular road. It is shown, that the implicitly defined coarse-level time stepper converges to the true dynamics on the slow manifold with an accuracy that is beyond all orders of the small parameter measuring time scale separation. These results are applied to investigate the behavior of the microscopic traffic model on a macroscopic level. The traffic jams are waves that travel slowly and in opposite direction compared to the car velocity. The standard deviation is chosen as a macroscopic measure of traveling wave solutions and is continued on the macroscopic level in the equation-free setup. The collapse of the traffic jam to the free flow corresponds in the relevant parameter region at the macroscopic level to a saddle-node bifurcation of the traveling wave. We continue this bifurcation point in two parameters using equation-free analysis.},

We limit our approach to very basic principles in terms of behavior, to focus on the particular problems raised by the non-smooth character of the models. We consider that individuals tend to move according to a desired, or spontanous, velocity. We account for congestion by assuming that the evolution realizes at each time an instantaneous balance between individual tendencies and global constraints (overlapping is forbidden): the actual velocity is defined as the closest to the desired velocity among all admissible ones, in a least square sense. We develop those principles in the microscopic and macroscopic settings, and we present how the framework of Wasserstein distance between measures allows to recover the sweeping process nature of the problem on the macroscopic level, which makes it possible to obtain existence results in spite of the non-smooth character of the evolution process. Micro and macro approaches are compared, and we investigate the similarities together with deep differences of those two levels of description.},

Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), in order to capture
the input data required for performing pedestrian
simulations. Pedestrian simulations can identify
potential threats already in the design phase of a
building and evaluate protective measures. The BIM
model serves as a central structure, which is going to be
optimized by simulations (cf. figure 1). The building
design is validated by a pedestrian simulation against
performance indicators like the overall evacuation time
or densities inside congestions. In order to improve the
corresponding performance of the building, the
simulator can automatically optimize relevant features
of the BIM model - like door openings and wave
breakers. After a review by the architect or engineer,
the changes can be directly transferred to the model.
Pedestrian streams turned out to be a limiting factor for
building safety, particularly regarding emergency
evacuation and the capacity of critical elements like
stairways, escalators and elevators.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the inferences that are drawn from physical models. It is this rather hazy separation between the descriptive and the explanatory aspects of science, between the functions of observational terms and of theoretical terms that has provided the material for much of the recent discussion in the philosophy of science. Three different levels of question can be asked about this, as about any other problem in philosophy of science. It is important to separate these levels, because the techniques used in answering them are significantly different. The aim is to begin from ordinary usage and when stipulation becomes necessary to choose those stipulations that will, so far as is possible, support those conceptual distinctions that are latent in actual scientific practice. A theory is something put forward to account for one or more empirical laws that are already known. It is not just a singular hypothesis but has some degree of generality. But it is something more than a mere higher-order generalization.},

  abstract  = {The paper is concerned with the empirical investigation of different types of schematised maps. In two experiments a standard floor plan was compared to three strongly schematised maps providing only route knowledge. With the help of one of the maps, the participants had to localise themselves in two tasks and performed two wayfinding tasks in a multi-level building they didnt know before. We recorded map usage time and a range of task performance measures. Although the map provided much less information, participants performed better in wayfinding with an unambiguous schematic map than with a floor plan. In the self localisation tasks, participants performed equally well with the detailed floor plan and with the schematised map versions. Like the users of a schematic map, users of a floor map presumably oriented on the network structure rather than on local geometric features. This allows them to limit the otherwise potentially very large search space in map-based self localisation. In both types of tasks participants looked at the schematised maps for a shorter time. Providing less than standard information like in a highly schematised map can lead to better performance. We conclude that providing unambiguous turning information (route knowledge) rather than survey knowledge is most crucial for wayfinding in unknown environments.},

Confederates intruded themselves into 129 naturally occurring waiting lines, and the defensive reactions of the queuers were noted. Queuers following the point of intrusion were more likely to object than those who preceded it; 2 intruders provoked more reaction than a single intruder; and buffers (passive confederates standing in line) dampened the queue's response to the intruders. Results suggest that the underlying structure of the queue is composed of replicated segments and that defense of the queue is local rather than systemic. Features particular to the waiting line that work against concerted action are described.},

First, the selection behavior of modes is used which appears in pattern formation of physical, chemical and biological systems. Coupled selection equations based on these pattern formation principles can be used as dynamical system approach to assignment problems. These differential equations guarantee feasibility of the obtained solutions which is of great importance in industrial applications. Second, a model of behavioral forces is used, which has been successfully applied to describe self-organized crowd behavior of pedestrians. This novel approach includes collision avoidance as well as error resistivity. In particular, in systems where failures are of concern, the suggested approach outperforms conventional methods in covering up for sudden external changes like breakdowns of some robotic units. The capability of this system is demonstrated in computer simulations.},

However, no previous study has examined the possibility of subliminal processing of perceptual grouping. The present work steps forward in the study of perceptual organization, reporting direct evidence of subliminal processing of Gestalt patterns. In two masked priming experiments, Gestalt patterns grouped by proximity or similarity that induced either a horizontal or vertical global orientation of the stimuli were presented as masked primes and followed by visible targets that could be congruent or incongruent with the orientation of the primes. The results showed a reliable priming effect in the complete absence of prime awareness for both proximity and similarity grouping principles. These findings suggest that a phenomenal report of the Gestalt pattern is not mandatory to observe an effect on the response based on the global properties of Gestalt stimuli.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines the linkages between system dynamics and the Carnegie School in their treatment of human decision making. It is argued that the structure of system dynamics models implicitly assumes bounded rationality in decision making and that recognition of this assumption would aid system dynamicists in model construction and in communication with other social science disciplines. The paper begins by examining Simon's "principle of bounded rationality" which draws attention to the cognitive limitations on the information gathering and processing powers of human decision makers. Forrester's "Market Growth Model" is used to illustrate the central theme that system dynamics models are portrayals of bounded rationality. Close examination of the model formulation reveals decision functions involving simple rules of thumb and limited information content. Finally, there is a discussion of the implications of Carnegie philosophy for system dynamics as it affects communication, model structuring, model analysis and future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary The chapter aims to criticize the postulates underlying the current studies on social influence and discard the one-sided association of social influence with questions and facts related to conformity and deviance. It shows several new directions, both conceptual and experimental, which could lead to an understanding of innovation; and demonstrates the importance of behavior style as a general source of social influence. Power effects and influence effects have been differentiated and have shown that the latter play a specific role in assigning attributes. Intraindividual consistency and interindividual consistency have a vital function in these inferential phenomena. They also have a vital function in processes related to influence. The chapter provides the different ways in which a consensus is arrived at: when the majority partner has a norm and the minority partner is deprived of any norm; when partners are equals and each is in possession of his or her own norm; and when the minority partner has a norm, which he or she opposes to the norm of the majority partner. Because a consensus is a result and a form of treating social conflict, by reducing the variation of inter and intraindividual responses, the chapter also dealt with the modalities of social influence-the dynamics of social conflict. The chapter develops a set of hypotheses and an experimental paradigm that allows beginning a study of innovation and of the influence of minorities on majorities. This is possible regardless of the nature of the norm (implicit or explicit), and that it can occur at the response level as well as the coding level. Special attention has been given to the direction of this influence, distinguishing between approach, avoidance, and polarization in relation to the minority.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the major breakthroughs in neuroscience is the emerging understanding of how signals from the external environment are extracted and represented in the primary sensory cortices of the mammalian brain. The operational principles of the rest of the cortex, however, have essentially remained in the dark. The discovery of grid cells, and their functional organization, opens the door to some of the first insights into the workings of the association cortices, at a stage of neural processing where firing properties are shaped not primarily by the nature of incoming sensory signals but rather by internal self-organizing principles. Grid cells are place-modulated neurons whose firing locations define a periodic triangular array overlaid on the entire space available to a moving animal. The unclouded firing pattern of these cells is rare within the association cortices. In this paper, we shall review recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of grid-cell formation which suggest that the pattern originates by competitive network interactions, and we shall relate these ideas to new insights regarding the organization of grid cells into functionally segregated modules.

  Abstract                 = {Social influence is the process by which individuals adapt their opinion, revise their beliefs, or change their behavior as a result of social interactions with other people. In our strongly interconnected society, social influence plays a prominent role in many self-organized phenomena such as herding in cultural markets, the spread of ideas and innovations, and the amplification of fears during epidemics. Yet, the mechanisms of opinion formation remain poorly understood, and existing physics-based models lack systematic empirical validation. Here, we report two controlled experiments showing how participants answering factual questions revise their initial judgments after being exposed to the opinion and confidence level of others. Based on the observation of 59 experimental subjects exposed to peer-opinion for 15 different items, we draw an influence map that describes the strength of peer influence during interactions. A simple process model derived from our observations demonstrates how opinions in a group of interacting people can converge or split over repeated interactions. In particular, we identify two major attractors of opinion: (i) the expert effect, induced by the presence of a highly confident individual in the group, and (ii) the majority effect, caused by the presence of a critical mass of laypeople sharing similar opinions. Additional simulations reveal the existence of a tipping point at which one attractor will dominate over the other, driving collective opinion in a given direction. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of public opinion formation and managing conflicting situations in which self-confident and better informed minorities challenge the views of a large uninformed majority.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the collective dynamics of crowd movements during stressful emergency situations is central to reducing the risk of deadly crowd disasters. Yet, their systematic experimental study remains a challenging open problem due to ethical and methodological constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate the viability of shared three-dimensional virtual environments as an experimental platform for conducting crowd experiments with real people. In particular, we show that crowds of real human subjects moving and interacting in an immersive three-dimensional virtual environment exhibit typical patterns of real crowds as observed in real-life crowded situations. These include the manifestation of social conventions and the emergence of self-organized patterns during egress scenarios. High-stress evacuation experiments conducted in this virtual environment reveal movements characterized by mass herding and dangerous overcrowding as they occur in crowd disasters. We describe the behavioural mechanisms at play under such extreme conditions and identify critical zones where overcrowding may occur. Furthermore, we show that herding spontaneously emerges from a density effect without the need to assume an increase of the individual tendency to imitate peers. Our experiments reveal the promise of immersive virtual environments as an ethical, cost-efficient, yet accurate platform for exploring crowd behaviour in high-risk situations with real human subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {Although cooperation is central to the organisation of many social systems, relatively little is known about cooperation in situations of collective emergency. When groups of people flee from a danger such as a burning building or a terrorist attack, the collective benefit of cooperation is important, but the cost of helping is high and the temptation to defect is strong. To explore the degree of cooperation in emergencies, we develop a new social game, the help-or-escape social dilemma. Under time and monetary pressure, players decide how much risk they are willing to take in order to help others. Results indicated that players took as much risk to help others during emergencies as they did under normal conditions. In both conditions, most players applied an egalitarian heuristic and helped others until their chance of success equalled that of the group. This strategy is less efficient during emergencies, however, because the increased time pressure results in fewer people helped. Furthermore, emergencies tend to amplify participants' initial tendency to cooperate, with prosocials becoming even more cooperative and individualists becoming even more selfish. Our framework offers new opportunities to study human cooperation and could help authorities to better manage crowd behaviours during mass emergencies.},

  abstract = {Introduction: We propose that active Bayesian inference - a general framework for decision-making - can equally be applied to interpersonal exchanges. Social cognition, however, entails special challenges. We address these challenges through a novel formulation of a formal model and demonstrate its psychological significance. Method: We review relevant literature, especially with regards to interpersonal representations, formulate a mathematical model and present a simulation study. The model accommodates normative models from utility theory and places them within the broader setting of Bayesian inference. Crucially, we endow people s prior beliefs, into which utilities are absorbed, with preferences of self and others. The simulation illustrates the model s dynamics and furnishes elementary predictions of the theory. Results: 1 Because beliefs about self and others inform both the desirability and plausibility of outcomes, in this framework interpersonal representations become beliefs that have to be actively inferred. This inference, akin to mentalizing in the psychological literature, is based upon the outcomes of interpersonal exchanges. 2 We show how some well-known social-psychological phenomena - e.g., self-serving biases - can be explained in terms of active interpersonal inference. 3 Mentalizing naturally entails Bayesian updating of how people value social outcomes. Crucially this includes inference about one s own qualities and preferences. Conclusion: We inaugurate a Bayes optimal framework for modeling intersubject variability in mentalizing during interpersonal exchanges. Here, interpersonal representations are endowed with explicit functional and affective properties. We suggest the active inference framework lends itself to the study of psychiatric conditions where mentalizing is distorted.},
  comment  = {<note author=gk > The authors use a game approach to model interpersonal inference at time steps. Each player's inference (beliefs) about self and others is modeled probabilistically using a Bayesian formulation. It might be interesting to model queue formation using the games idea without necessarily usning the Bayesian formulation using light-weight and tailored distributions. </note>},

An extended review of Rational Choice Theory (RCT) from its first developments to current trends makes explicit the mismatch between RCT and empirical work settings. A review of recent theories on the cognitive abilities of agents makes clear the lack of integration between findings in evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, perceptual psychology and neurology, and those proposed by RCT. We will examine the causes for the failure of Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI), the strongest empirical program for testing RCT premises. Contributions from the cognitive and social sciences put forward the weaknesses of analytical sociology at all four levels: the biological, the psychological, the epistemological, and the ontological. Alternative explanations from contemporary cognitive science will be put forward.},

  abstract = {A simple, rule-based approach to traffic flow can yield astonishingly realistic results and is therefore a candidate for very fast large scale microscopic traffic simulations. In the present article, we evaluate two conceptually different codings of the same dynamics on parallel supercomputers. We use a Parsytec GCel-3 (1024 nodes), an Intel iPSC/860 (32 nodes), and a Connection Machine CM-5 (32 nodes). For comparison purposes, we use as well a NEC-SX3/11 traditional single node vector computer, and a net of coupled workstations. Compared to published computing speeds of microscopic traffic models, our model proves to be up to about 1000 times faster. We find our highest computing speed by employing a single-bit coding scheme used in, e.g., Ising-model programming. As traffic flow is a one-dimensional problem, a complication is that geometric parallelization has to be done in the same direction as single-bit coding. Nevertheless, we reach efficiencies near 100 percent for large systems. We use these computational resources in order to obtain high quality data of the model's average behavior (fundamental diagrams). In addition, we present results from modeling a road network, whose composition out of basic objects leads in a natural way to some temporal 'slackness' which helps balancing load asymmetries.},

First, we introduce a model of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for describing the process of fish school's obstacle avoidance. Second, on the basis of the model we find obstacle avoiding patterns. Our observations show that there are clear four obstacle avoiding patterns, namely, Rebound, Pullback, Pass and Reunion, and Separation. Furthermore, the emerging patterns change when parameters change. Finally, we present a scientific definition for fish school's cohesiveness that will be an internal property characterizing the strength of fish schooling. There are then evidences that the school cohesiveness can be measured through obstacle avoiding patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Reviews evidence which suggests that there may be little or no direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes. Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.},

  Abstract                 = {The slow processes of metastable stochastic dynamical systems are difficult to access by direct numerical simulation due to the sampling problems. Here, we suggest an approach for modeling the slow parts of Markov processes by approximating the dominant eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the propagator. To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient. It is shown that this Rayleigh coefficient can be estimated
from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena.},

Based on these hypotheses, a research project was initiated. As a part of the project, an initial literature study has been conducted. The literature study has made an attempt to summarize the most important findings of previous research about physical exhaustion and design of stairs for ascending evacuation in long stairs. This paper presents the findings from the literature study.},

In Study 1, participants (N =39) in minimal groups were told that they would be interacting with another person. In line with expectations, personal space (as measured by the distance between chairs) was significantly less in the intragroup context than in the intergroup and interpersonal contexts. This finding was replicated in Study 2 (N =80) using an improved experimental design. These results are discussed in terms of developing a self-categorization account of personal space and crowding.},

  Abstract                 = {Exposure to crowding is said to be aversive, yet people also seek out and enjoy crowded situations. We surveyed participants at two crowd events to test the prediction of self-categorization theory that variable emotional responses to crowding are a function of social identification with the crowd. In data collected from participants who attended a crowded outdoor music event (n = 48), identification with the crowd predicted feeling less crowded; and there was an indirect effect of identification with the crowd on positive emotion through feeling less crowded. Identification with the crowd also moderated the relation between feeling less crowded and positive emotion. In data collected at a demonstration march (n =112), identification with the crowd predicted central (most dense) location in the crowd; and there was an indirect effect of identification with the crowd on positive emotion through central location in the crowd. Positive emotion in the crowd also increased over the duration of the crowd event. These findings are in line with the predictions of self-categorization theory. They are inconsistent with approaches that suggest that crowding is inherently aversive; and they cannot easily be explained through the concept of "personal space".},

As a consequence of the contributions from different disciplines, we present a framework that describes the bidirectional links between decision making, perception, and action. We will argue that, given their interdependency, the study of decision making profits greatly from a more integrated view of the situations it studies. The framework also illustrates how constraints may influence these bidirectional links. Finally, we use this framework to convey new ideas for experimental paradigms, data interpretation, and applications.},

After an analytical study of the stability and local bifurcations of the steady-state solution, we apply numerical continuation techniques to investigate the global behavior of the system.

Einfluss verschiedener Simulationsparameter auf diese mit Hilfe vom J{\"u}lich Pedestrian Simulator.
Dazu werden alle Arbeitsschritte abgearbeitet, die bei einer R{\"a}umungssimulation
von Bedeutung sind.
Zun{\"a}chst wird der Stand der Wissenschaft in Bezug auf die freie Gehgeschwindigkeit auf
Treppen und fahrenden bzw. stehenden Fahrtreppen erfasst. Weiterf{\"u}hrend sind hierzu
Ergebnisse eigener Experimente dokumentiert. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus werden alle Grundlagen
zu mathematischen Modellierungsmodellen erarbeitet und beschrieben, aus welchen Komponenten
die Software J{\"u}lich Pedestrian Simulator besteht.
Im Anschluss erfolgt die Erstellung des Geometriemodells der U-Bahnstation, das nicht
nur als generisches Fl{\"a}chen-Volumenk{\"o}rper-Modell auf CAD-Basis f{\"u}r Rauchgassimulationen
dienen kann, sondern auch als Drahtmodell f{\"u}r die Personenstromsimulation benutzt
wird. 
Als letzte Komponente werden f{\"u}r die Simulation die Parameters{\"a}tze zusammengetragen,
die zur Analyse der Einflussfaktoren dienen. Dabei werden sowohl der Ansatz von unterschiedlichen
Geschwindigkeiten auf Treppen bzw. Fahrtreppen, als auch verschiedene
Reaktionszeiten auf ihren Einfluss auf die R{\"a}umungszeit untersucht.
Die anschlie{\ss}enden Simulationen ergeben, dass eine Erh{\"o}hung der Reaktionszeit unter den
gew{\"a}hlten Parametern eine Erh{\"o}hung der Evakuierungszeit zu Folge hat. Eine Vergr{\"o}{\ss}erung
der Gehgeschwindigkeit auf Treppen hingegen verringert die simulierte Evakuierungszeit.

As cultural values vary, so do psychological needs; and house form changes accordingly. The basic boundaries in the house are expressions of social classifications which regulate human behaviour, and boundaries are a useful focus when considering the meaning and cultural variation of house design. In the present study, data on spatial boundaries (house plans) are interpreted in the light of the Japanese emphasis on the inside---outside classification, which not only forms a physical demarcation in and around the house but also creates and reinforces psychological boundaries in human relationships. The social boundaries which define and maintain this classification are also evident in phenomenological accounts of Japanese people resident in the United Kingdom.},

  abstract = {In opportunistic networking, characterizing contact patterns between mobile users is essential for assessing feasibility and performance of opportunistic applications. There has been significant efforts in deriving this characterization, based on observations and trace analyses; however, most of the previously established results were obtained by studying contact opportunities at large spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, the user population is considered to be constant: no user can join or leave the system. Yet, there are many examples of scenarios which do not fully adhere to the previous assumption and cannot be accurately described at large scales. Urban environments, such as smaller city districts, are characterized by highly dynamic user populations. We believe that scenarios with varying population require further investigation. In this paper, we present a novel modeling approach to study operation of opportunistic applications in scenarios where the population size is subjected to frequent changes, that is, it exhibits churn. We examine two location-based content sharing schemes: a purely opportunistic case and an infrastructure-supported content sharing scheme, for which we provide stochastic models based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We validate our models in five scenarios: a city area, subway station, conference, campus, and a scenario with a synthetic mobility model and we show that the models provide good representations of the investigated scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {This dissertation addresses the problem of bringing the perspectives of psychology and sociology about human behavior in emergencies into computational models for egress analysis. Efficacious analysis of emergency egress is facilitated by incorporation of diverse human behavior into a Multi-Agent Simulation System for Egress analysis (MASSEgress). MASSEgress adopts a multi-agent based simulation paradigm to model evacuees as individual agents equipped with sensors, brains and actuators. Individual behavior is simulated through modeling of sensing, decision-making, behavior selection and motor control. Social behavior is simulated through modeling of individual behavior and interactions among individuals. Competitive, queuing, herding, and leader-following behaviors are modeled. MASSEgress is a computational framework; its modular design allows easy extensions to include additional behavior types. A set of computational methods including point-test and ray-tracing algorithms, and decision-trees are incorporated into MASSEgress to simulate the sensing, decision-making, behavior selection, and motor control of evacuees. A grid method is utilized to perform collision detection among large number of agents with an O(N) time complexity, and K-Means clustering algorithm is utilized to develop statistical procedures for drawing evacuation patterns from multiple simulations. Comparisons of MASSEgress with other evacuation models have been performed to demonstrate its capabilities as well as to validate the computational framework with prior results. Simulation to replicate a historical event - evacuation at a Rhode Island nightclub has also been carried out. Finally, an application of MASSEgress to simulate emergency evacuation of a multi-story university building is performed to illustrate the potential utilization of the simulation system for egress design analysis.},

  comment   = {Unfortunately the authors fail to mention why their approach should be more consistent or more realisitic then the former approaches whose lack of realism the authors deplore. The agent based model framework does not use observations to validate. Input from the social sciences and psychology is considered in an abstract fashion only - through literature citations. There is no investigation of stability and robustness, a typical weekness, when different behaviours have to be balanced in a Reynold's style model such as this. In short, the model lacks validation. It's worth may lie in a solid SW structure - which I cannot judge.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns a review and critical assessment of the existing research on pedestrian behaviour in urban areas, focusing on two separate yet complementary aspects: route choice and crossing behaviour. First, an exhaustive review of the existing route choice models for pedestrians is presented. It is shown that the existing models are mainly more stochastic and more macroscopic than required and seldom incorporate the interactions between pedestrians and traffic. Second, the existing models on pedestrians crossing behaviour are presented and assessed. It is shown that, although their approach is usually detailed, deterministic and traffic-oriented, they are mainly devoted to a local level behaviour and focus on only one type of all the potential determinants. Most importantly, these two complementary and possibly interdependent aspects of pedestrian behaviour are always examined separately. The results of this review reveal a lack of an overall and detailed consideration of pedestrian behaviour along an entire trip in urban areas. Moreover, the need for an integrated approach based on flexibility, disaggregation and more determinism is identified. Accordingly, a set of modelling techniques are discussed as a general framework for further research in the field.},

The method, superficially, is relatively simple to implement, and is slowly gaining industrial acceptance. Unfortunately, very little has been published on how the method works. To those who are uninitiated, this powerful approach remains a black art. This paper demonstrates that the Monte Carlo simulation method is fully compatible with the conventional uncertainty estimation methods for linear systems and systems that have small uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation has the ability to take account of partial correlated measurement input uncertainties. It also examines the uncertainties of the results of some basic manipulations e.g. addition, multiplication and division, of two input measured variables which may or may not be correlated. For correlated input measurements, the probability distribution of the result could be biased or skewed. These properties cannot be revealed using conventional methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Since its mathematical formulation, Brownian motion is the most important
stochastic process in probability theory. In the Fourties and Fifties,
pioneers as Kakutani and Doob did some research in the area of stochastical
analysis and recognized the importance of Brownian motion for the
Dirichlet problem.
This master thesis intends to give an explanation of the connection of
Brownian motion and the Dirichlet problem in a modern, mathematical and
closed context.
Although the results can be further generalized to Markov processes,
in case of Brownian motion and its useful properties, they stay clear and
understandable which effects the corresponding proofs.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of virtual pedestrian autonomous navigation for crowd simulation. It describes a method for solving interactions between pedestrians and avoiding inter-collisions. Our approach is agent-based and predictive: each agent perceives surrounding agents and extrapolates their trajectory in order to react to potential collisions. We aim at obtaining realistic results, thus the proposed model is calibrated from experimental motion capture data. Our method is shown to be valid and solves major drawbacks compared to previous approaches such as oscillations due to a lack of anticipation. We first describe the mathematical representation used in our model, we then detail its implementation, and finally, its calibration and validation from real data.},

The degree of panic is controlled by a parameter v d which represents the velocity at which pedestrians wish to move. We show that the "faster is slower effect" can be understood in terms of the works performed by the different forces present in the system and the role played by dissipative terms in the model. Beyond the maximum flow rate the "granular cluster" mass distribution displays a transition from exponentially decaying to "U-shaped" as this value of v d evacuation efficiency begins to decrease rapidly.},

Vicsek, Nature (London) 407, 487 (2000)]. FIS refers to the finding that, under certain conditions, an excess of the individuals' vigor in the attempt to exit causes a decrease in the flow rate. In general, this effect is identified by the appearance of a minimum when plotting the total evacuation time of a crowd as a function of the pedestrian desired velocity. Here, we experimentally show that the FIS effect indeed occurs in three different systems of discrete particles flowing through a constriction: (a) humans evacuating a room, (b) a herd of sheep entering a barn, and (c) grains flowing out a 2D hopper over a vibrated incline. This finding suggests that FIS is a universal phenomenon for active matter passing through a narrowing.},

  abstract = {The time that it takes an occupant population to reach safety when descending a stairwell during building evacuations is typically described by measurable engineering variables such as stairwell geometry, speed, density, and pre-evacuation delay. In turn, engineering models of building evacuation use these variables to predict the performance of egress systems for building design, emergency planning, or event reconstruction. As part of a program to better understand occupant movement and behavior during building emergencies, the Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been collecting stairwell movement data during fire drill evacuations of office buildings. These data collections are intended to provide a better understanding of this principal building egress feature and develop a technical foundation for future codes and standards requirements. To date, \{NIST\} has collected fire drill evacuation data in eight office building occupancies ranging from 6 to 62 stories in height that have included a range of stairwell widths and occupant densities. While average movement speeds in the current study of 0.48 m/s+/- 0.16 m/s are observed to be quite similar to the range of literature values, local movement speeds as occupants traverse down the stairwell are seen to vary widely within a given stairwell, ranging from 0.056 m/s to 1.7 m/s. These data should provide confirmation of the adequacy of existing literature values typically used for occupant movement speeds or provide updated values for future analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {There are many applications of computer animation and simulation where it is necessary to model virtual crowds of autonomous agents. Some of these applications include site planning, education, entertainment, training, and human factors analysis for building evacuation. Other applications include simulations of scenarios where masses of people gather, flow, and disperse, such as transportation centers, sporting events, and concerts. Most crowd simulations include only basic locomotive behaviors possibly coupled with a few stochastic actions. Our goal in this survey is to establish a baseline of techniques and requirements for simulating large-scale virtual human populations. Sometimes, these populations might be mutually engaged in a common activity such as evacuation from a building or area; other times they may be going about their individual and personal agenda of work, play, leisure, travel, or spectator. Computational methods to model one set of requirements may not mesh well with good approaches to another. By including both crowd and individual goals and constraints into a comprehensive computational model, we expect to simulate the visual texture and contextual behaviors of groups of seemingly sentient beings.},

Typical approaches either resemble particle simulations (where agents lack orientation controls) or are conservative in the range of human motion possible (agents lack psychological state and aren't allowed to 'push' each other). Our HiDAC system (for High-Density Autonomous Crowds) focuses on the problem of simulating the local motion and global wayfinding behaviors of crowds moving in a natural manner within dynamically changing virtual environments. By applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model, HiDAC exhibits a wide variety of emergent behaviors from agent line formation to pushing behavior and its consequences; relative to the current situation, personalities of the individuals and perceived social density.},

  abstract = {We describe a new architecture to integrate a psychological model into a crowd simulation system in order to obtain believable emergent behaviors. Our existing crowd simulation system (MACES) performs high level wayfinding to explore unknown environments and obtain a cognitive map for navigation purposes, in addition to dealing with low level motion within each room based on social forces. Communication and roles are added to achieve individualistic behaviors and a realistic way to spread information about the environment. To expand the range of realistic human behaviors, we use a system (PMFserv) that implements human behavior models from a range of ability, stress, emotion, decision theoretic and motivation sources. An architecture is proposed that combines and integrates MACES and PMFserv to add validated agent behaviors to crowd simulations.},

  abstract  = {Multi-fidelity modelling enables accurate inference of quantities of interest by synergistically combining
realizations of low-cost/low-fidelity models with a small set of high-fidelity observations. This isparticularly effective when the low- and high-fidelity
models exhibit strong correlations, and can lead to significant computational gains over approaches
that solely rely on high-fidelity models. However, in many cases of practical interest, low-fidelity models
can only be well correlated to their high-fidelity counterparts for a specific range of input parameters,
and potentially return wrong trends and erroneous predictions if probed outside of their validity regime.
Here we put forth a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian process regression and nonlinear
autoregressive schemes that is capable of learning complex nonlinear and space-dependent crosscorrelations
between models of variable fidelity, and can effectively safeguard against low-fidelity models
that provide wrong trends. This introduces a new class of multi-fidelity information fusion algorithms
that provide a fundamental extension to the existing linear autoregressive methodologies, while still
maintaining the same algorithmic complexity and overall computational cost. The performance of the
proposed methods is tested in several benchmark problems involving both synthetic and real multifidelity
datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

In the process, we also obtain new theoretical results on the limits of "Laplacian type" matrices derived from directed graphs.

more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add to the code) knowing the underlying
principles. We find the node locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using piecewise
linear force-displacement relations) and we reset the topology by the Delaunay algorithm.
The geometry is described implicitly by its distance function. In addition to being much shorter
and simpler than other meshing techniques, our algorithm typically produces meshes of very high
quality. We discuss ways to improve the robustness and the performance, but our aim here is
simplicity. Readers can download (and edit) the codes from http://math.mit.edu/~persson/mesh.},

To this end we have analysed ants'-perspective views of a habitat within which desert ant navigation is well studied. Results from our analysis suggest that: parsimonious visual strategies for homing and route guidance are effective over behaviourally useful distances even in cluttered environments; that these strategies can function effectively using only the skyline heights as input; and that the simplicity and efficacy of using stored views as a visual compass makes it a viable and robust mechanism for route guidance.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing desire for mobility, rising prices of gasoline and steadily growing awareness for environmental issues create a wide range of opportunities for public transport, especially the public railway services. Customization of railway services is a key issue to win over passengers. Handling luggage on the train often constitutes a major obstacle to using trains as a means of transportation. Therefore an improvement in the area of luggage accommodation on trains would result in an increase of comfort for travelers.
The aim of this theses is to determine the amount of luggage carried on passenger trains as well as an analysis of the desires and behavior of passengers. Further a standardization of luggage is conducted. Based on this standardization the appropriate size, allocation and arrangement of areas for luggage accommodation are identified. For this purpose luggage was measured and counted on platforms in Germany and Austria on multiple occasions throughout the year 2007. In addition about 1000 pieces of luggage were measured and weighed at the airports of Vienna and Salzburg. To obtain additional data, surveys among 6500 travelers were conducted on about 160 trains in Germany in summer 2007 and in Switzerland in January 2008. In the course of surveys, videos have been taken to analyze 1500 railway cars.
At the beginning of the thesis passenger structures with consideration of group sizes and travel purposes are examined. The analysis of the behavior of travelers shows that the readiness to lift luggage for storage decreases with the vertical lift, the weight of the object and the age of the travelers. Female travelers are generally less willing to lift luggage, while permanent visual contact is most important for all passengers. According to the conducted survey, passengers want luggage racks close to their seats as well as storage opportunities between the seats. Overhead storage and luggage racks within the entrance area are rejected. Further the luggage arising for different traveler groups and its purpose are determined. Travelers on average carry one piece of luggage and half a piece of hand luggage with them.
In a separate chapter the data from luggage countings and measurements is accurately standardized into categories of trolley / suitcase, bag, backpack and hand luggage as well as into the size categories small, medium, large and weight categories light, medium, heavy. This standardization allows to draw conclusions from the specifications travelers made in the questionnaires on their luggage.
Based on the evaluation of the video recordings, the actual accommodation of luggage and passenger capacity utilization in trains are examined. It is shown that even during high extent of utilization the existing accommodation possibilities (80% in form of overhead storage) are not fully used and luggage items are placed on seats and in the aisle. An increase of difficulties in luggage storing becomes evident when the number of passengers grows to full capacity of the train and therefore leads to an increase of unsatisfied customers.
In the final part of the thesis a computing method is presented which allows to determine the necessary storage capacity according to existing traveling purposes togehter with seating requirements for a railroad car. In addition, measurements are defined to guarantee the maximum amount of storage possibilities. A setting of the luggage racks on the quarter points of the car in addition with evenly distributed storage places between the seats guarantee an arrangement appropriate to the passenger behavior and the costumer requests. By optimizing luggage storage areas according to customer needs, higher customer satisfaction and increased operating efficiency (e.g. shorter passenger change times) can be achieved. This could result in an increase of total number of passengers by 20%.

The velocity density relation using measurements on a 'microscopic' scale shows the coexistence of two phases at one density. These data are used to calibrate and verify a spatially continuous model. Several criteria are chosen that a model has to satisfy: firstly we investigated the fundamental diagram (velocity versus density) using different measurement methods. Furthermore the trajectories are compared to the occurrence of stop-and-go waves qualitatively. Finally we checked the distribution of the velocities at fixed density against the experimental one. The adaptive velocity model introduced satisfies these criteria well.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the paper is an analysis of self-organization patterns observed in the unidirectional flow of pedestrians. On the basis of experimental data from Zhang et al. [J. Zhang et al., J. Stat. Mech. (2011) P06004], we analyze the mutual positions and velocity correlations between pedestrians when walking along a corridor. The angular and spatial dependencies of the mutual positions reveal a spatial structure that remains stable during the crowd motion. This structure differs depending on the value of n, for the consecutive nth-nearest-neighbor position set. The preferred position for the first-nearest neighbor is on the side of the pedestrian, while for further neighbors, this preference shifts to the axis of movement. The velocity correlations vary with the angle formed by the pair of neighboring pedestrians and the direction of motion and with the time delay between pedestrians' movements. The delay dependence of the correlations shows characteristic oscillations, produced by the velocity oscillations when striding; however, a filtering of the main frequency of individual striding out reduces the oscillations only partially. We conclude that pedestrians select their path directions so as to evade the necessity of continuously adjusting their speed to their neighbors'. They try to keep a given distance, but follow the person in front of them, as well as accepting and observing pedestrians on their sides. Additionally, we show an empirical example that illustrates the shape of a pedestrian's personal space during movement.},

  Abstract                 = {How many times have you been sitting in rush-hour traffic thinking, "Hey, I know where I want to go. And I'm sure everyone around me knows where they want to go, too. If we could just work together, I'll bet we would all get where we wanted to go a lot easier, faster, and without rear-ending each other"? As your frustration rises, you realize that impatient commuters aren't the most cooperative people. However, if you're a game player, uncooperative resource gatherers and infantry are probably even more frustrating than a real-life traffic jam. Figuring out how to get hundreds of units moving around a complex game map in real time - commonly referred to as pathfinding - is a tough task. While pathfinding is a hot industry buzzword, it's only half of the solution. Movement, the execution of a given path, is the other half of the solution. For real-time strategy games, this movement goes hand in hand with pathfinding. An axeman certainly needs a plan (as in, a path) for how he's going to get from one side of his town to the other to help stave off the enemy invasion. If he doesn't execute that plan using a good movement system, however, all may be lost. Game Developer has already visited the topic of pathfinding in such past articles as "Smart Move: Path-Finding" by Brian Stout (October/November 1996) and "Real-Time Pathfinding for Multiple Objects" by Swen Vincke (June 1997). Rather than go over the same material, I'll approach the problem from the other side by examining the ways to execute a path that's already been found. In this article, I'll cover the basic components of an effective movement system. In a companion article in next month's Game Developer, I'll extend these basic concepts to cover higher-order movement and implementation. Though the examples in these articles focus mainly on a real-time strategy game, the methods I'll describe can easily be applied to other genres.},

  Abstract                 = {Part of the fun of working in the game industry is the constant demand for technical innovations that will allow designers to create better games. In the real-time strategy (RTS) genre, most developers are focusing on improving group movement for their next round of games. I'm not talking about the relatively low-tech methods cur- rently in use. Instead, I'm referring to coordinated group movement, where units cooperate with each other to move around the map with intelligence and cohesion. Any RTS game developer that wants to be competitive needs to look beyond simple unit movement; only the games that weigh in with solid coordinated movement systems will go the distance. In this article, the second and final part of my coordinated unit movement series, we'll take a look at how to use the systems that we considered in the first article to satisfy our coordinated group movement goal. We'll also examine how we can use our coordinated movement fundamentals to solve some classic, complex movement problems. While we will spend most of our time talking about these features through the RTS microscope, they can easily be applied to other types of games.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple variation of the well-known method of minimizing a function of several variables by changing one parameter at a time is described. This variation is such that when the procedure is applied to a quadratic form, it causes conjugate directions to be chosen, so the ultimate rate of convergence is fast when the method is used to minimize a general function. A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

A time saving boarding strategy is required to improve the utilization of airplane boarding time and explore flexible time management strategies. Firstly, an improved boarding strategy is introduced by assigning individual passengers to seats based on the number of luggage they carry. Passengers with the most luggage board onto the plane first. To test the behavior of boarding strategies under different conditions, a sophisticated simulation environment based on cellular automata model is designed. Simulation results indicate that the improved boarding strategy shows an excellent efficiency and robustness comparing with other strategies.},

Group modeling is still an open challenging problem and has not been incorporated by existing crowd simulation models. Motivated by the need of group modeling for crowd behavior simulation, this paper presents a unified and well-defined framework for modeling the structure aspect of different groups in a pedestrian crowd. Both intra-group structure and inter-group relationships are considered and their effects on the crowd behavior are modeled. Based on this framework, an agent-based crowd simulation system is developed and crowd behavior simulations using two different group structures are presented. The simulation results show that the developed framework allows different group structures to be easily modeled. Besides, different group sizes, intra-group structures and inter-group relationships can have significant impacts on crowd behavior.},

Compared with original models that described the pedestrian's planar motion, our model introduces some mechanisms of the staircase movement, such as the influence of staircase geometry, the restriction of the step size and the optimal velocity selection. The body shape of each pedestrian is regarded as a set of three circles to precisely quantify the movement. In addition, the rotation dynamics are included into the model to describe the congestion effect. The improved model can obtain individual velocity under different staircase geometries and the flow characteristics of the evacuation dynamics. Some empirical data and a series of observations captured in two subway stations in Beijing are applied to study the characteristics and further validate the model. The results show that our model performs well consistent with the observed data. At last, simulations are implemented to find the solutions of estimating the evacuation time and evaluating the capacity of stair.},

  year     = {2010},
  comment  = {In this thesis, we describe a new approach for detecting and tracking the behavior of dy- namical systems. The goal is to identify trends that deviate from normal behavior. A high-dimensional dataset, which describes the measured/observed parameters of a dynam- ical system, is embedded into a lower-dimension space by the application of the diffusion maps to it. Then, the sought after anomalies are detected in this lower-dimension em- bedded space. To achieve it, the diffusion maps methodology was extended to provide hierarchal (multi-scale) processing via the construction of super graphs. The frequency appearance of each point in the embedded space is quantitatively measures the system's state at each given time point. In addition, the data was reformulated to extract its hidden underlying oscillatory behavior which turns out to be a major source for failure of dynam- ical systems. Most of the presented algorithms have two sequential steps: training and detection. Graph alignment was developed to signal when the current computed training baseline data has to be updated. The classification of the status of each newly arrived data point as normal or abnormal depends on its location coordinates. These coordinates are determined by the application of a multi-scale Gaussian approximation procedure. In a second part of the thesis, we propose three novel algorithms for the detection of vehicles based on their recordings. The algorithms use different methods like wavelet packets and random projections to extract spatio-temporal characteristic features from the recordings. These form a unique acoustic signature for each of the recordings. The feature extraction procedure is followed by a dimensionality reduction step for reducing the size of the signature. The methods that are utilized are diffusion maps, classification trees and principal component analysis. A new recording can be classified by employing similar steps in the low dimensional structures, which were constructed on a training set, are extended to the newly collected acoustic recordings.},

  Abstract                 = {Waiting is examined here as a psychological experience, through propositions regarding the relationship between the design of a queue and the emotions and attitudes of people waiting. Propositions are tested using a paradigm that both controls features of queue structure and allows collection of real-time data from people waiting. Data collected from 134 participants confirm that people closer to a service agent are more pleased than those further away. But people waiting in a single-queue structure are shown to feel more predictability and arousal than those waiting in a multiple-queue structure. Waiting in a multiple-queue structure is, however, shown to produce a sense of lack of justice, even when no objective inequalities exist. The study suggests a useful paradigm for evaluating alternative queue structures in a laboratory setting and provides insights about psychological aspects of waiting. Both the method and the results suggest an extensive agenda for future research.},

  abstract = {The asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) has attracted a lot of interest not only because of its many applications, e.g., in the context of the kinetics of biopolymerization and traffic flow theory, but also because it is a paradigmatic model for nonequilibrium systems. Here we study the ASEP for different types of updates, namely random-sequential, sequential, sublattice-parallel, and parallel. In order to compare the effects of the different update procedures on the properties of the stationary state, we use large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods, especially the so-called matrix-product Ansatz (MPA). We present in detail the exact solution for the model with sublattice-parallel and sequential updates using the MPA. For the case of parallel update, which is important for applications like traffic flow theory, we determine the phase diagram, the current, and density profiles based on Monte Carlo simulations. We furthermore suggest an MPA for that case and derive the corresponding matrix algebra.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of motion crowds is concerned with the detection of potential hazards for individuals of the crowd. Existing methods analyze the statistics of pixel motion to classify non-dangerous or dangerous behavior, to detect outlier motions, or to estimate the mean throughput of people for an image region. We suggest a biologically inspired model for the analysis of motion crowds that extracts motion features indicative for potential dangers in crowd behavior. Our model consists of stages for motion detection, integration, and pattern detection that model functions of the primate primary visual cortex area (V1), the middle temporal area (MT), and the medial superior temporal area (MST), respectively. This model allows for the processing of motion transparency, the appearance of multiple motions in the same visual region, in addition to processing opaque motion. We suggest that motion transparency helps to identify "danger zones" in motion crowds. For instance, motion transparency occurs in small exit passages during evacuation. However, motion transparency occurs also for non-dangerous crowd behavior when people move in opposite directions organized into separate lanes. Our analysis suggests: The combination of motion transparency and a slow motion speed can be used for labeling of candidate regions that contain dangerous behavior. In addition, locally detected decelerations or negative speed gradients of motions are a precursor of danger in crowd behavior as are globally detected motion patterns that show a contraction toward a single point. In sum, motion transparency, image speeds, motion patterns, and speed gradients extracted from visual motion in videos are important features to describe the behavioral state of a motion crowd.},

  Abstract                 = {Animals process sensory information according to specific computational rules and, subsequently, form representations of their environments that form the basis for decisions and choices. The specific computational rules used by organisms will often be evolutionarily adaptive by generating higher probabilities of survival, reproduction, and resource acquisition. Experiments with enclosed colonies of bumblebees constrained to foraging on artificial flowers suggest that the bumblebee's cognitive architecture is designed to efficiently exploit floral resources from spatially structured environments given limits on memory and the neuronal processing of information. A non-linear relationship between the biomechanics of nectar extraction and rates of net energetic gain by individual bees may account for sensitivities to both the arithmetic mean and variance in reward distributions in flowers. Heuristic rules that lead to efficient resource exploitation may also lead to subjective misperception of likelihoods. Subjective probability formation may then be viewed as a problem in pattern recognition subject to specific sampling schemes and memory constraints.},

The two-dimensional eigenfunctions, corresponding to the two inhomogeneous duct directions, are optimal in the energy sense. The database used to form the two-point correlation tensor is obtained from a low Reynolds number direct numerical simulation of the flow field. The symmetries inherent in the square cross section allow the formulation of the integral eigenvalue problem over one octant, producing an eigensystem of manageable size without losing any spatial scales. The extraction process reveals a gradual decrease of modal energies rather than a single dominant eigenfunction. Reconstructions of instantaneous velocity fields and Reynolds stresses indicate the efficiency, as it pertains to identifying structures and storing data, of the proper orthogonal decomposition method for this problem.},

By unconstrained, we refer to behavior patterns which are independent from other individuals. The constrained patterns are captured by a leader-follower model and by a collision avoidance model. The spatial correlation between the alternatives is captured by a cross nested logit model. The model is estimated by maximum likelihood estimation on a real data set of pedestrian trajectories, manually tracked from video sequences. The model is successfully validated using a bi-directional flow data set, collected in controlled experimental conditions at Delft university.},

Previously, such validation has commonly used the hypothesis of no difference as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is acceptable. This is unsatisfactory, because using this approach tests are more likely to validate a model if they have low power. Here we suggest the usage of tests of equivalence, which use the hypothesis of dissimilarity as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is unacceptable. Thus, they flip the burden of proof back onto the model. We demonstrate the application of equivalence testing to model validation using an empirical forest growth model and an extensive database of field measurements. Finally we provide some simple power analyses to guide future model validation exercises.},

The objective of the present study is to investigate the applicability of three widely used techniques to three computer models having large uncertainties and varying degrees of complexity in order to highlight some of the problem areas that must be addressed in actual applications. The following approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are considered: (1) response surface methodology based on input determined from a fractional factorial design; (2) Latin hypercube sampling with and without regression analysis; and (3) differential analysis. These techniques are investigated with respect to (1) ease of implementation, (2) flexibility, (3) estimation of the cumulative distribution function of the output, and (4) adaptability to different methods of sensitivity analysis. With respect to these criteria, the technique using Latin hypercube sampling and regression analysis had the best overall performance. The models used in the investigation are well documented, thus making it possible for researchers to make comparisons of other techniques with the results in this study.},

Four main types of tests have been reported in the literature, 1) component testing, 2) functional verification, 3) qualitative verification and 4) quantitative validation. An important issue relates to the stage in which the V\&V procedure is employed. In fact, the listed four forms of V\&V can be performed in two different stages, namely 1) after the model is built or 2) as an integral part of the model building process. The present study presents an example of the second strategy, i.e., the use of the V\&V tests as an integral part of the model building process. Examples are made in order to demonstrate the need for dedicated tests in relation to the type of model when adopting this strategy. A set of experimental data collected at the Department of Fire Safety Engineering and Systems Safety at Lund University (Sweden) has been employed to evaluate the capabilities of an evacuation model and provide guidance on its development. This was possible performing V\&V tests for which experimental data are generally scarce, i.e. quantitative validation. Results are used to identify the advantages deriving from the use of quantitative validation tests during the design stage of a model and assess some of the key aspects that need to be addressed in models which are not included in current V\&V tests/procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {Coordination among social animals requires rapid and efficient transfer of information among individuals, which may depend crucially on the underlying structure of the communication network. Establishing the decision-making circuits and networks that give rise to individual behavior has been a central goal of neuroscience. However, the analogous problem of determining the structure of the communication network among organisms that gives rise to coordinated collective behavior, such as is exhibited by schooling fish and flocking birds, has remained almost entirely neglected. Here, we study collective evasion maneuvers, manifested through rapid waves, or cascades, of behavioral change (a ubiquitous behavior among taxa) in schooling fish (Notemigonus crysoleucas). We automatically track the positions and body postures, calculate visual fields of all individuals in schools of ~150 fish, and determine the functional mapping between socially generated sensory input and motor response during collective evasion. We find that individuals use simple, robust measures to assess behavioral changes in neighbors, and that the resulting networks by which behavior propagates throughout groups are complex, being weighted, directed, and heterogeneous. By studying these interaction networks, we reveal the (complex, fractional) nature of social contagion and establish that individuals with relatively few, but strongly connected, neighbors are both most socially influential and most susceptible to social influence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can predict complex cascades of behavioral change at their moment of initiation, before they actually occur. Consequently, despite the intrinsic stochasticity of individual behavior, establishing the hidden communication networks in large self-organized groups facilitates a quantitative understanding of behavioral contagion.},

Interception of moving and stationary objects can be achieved through regulation of self-movement to maintain a target at a constant eccentricity, or by cancelling the change (drift) in the eccentricity of the target. We first show how a constant eccentricity strategy can be extended to home in on optimal paths and avoid obstacles. We then identify a simple visual speed ratio that signals a future collision, and the change in path needed for avoidance. The combination of heuristics based on eccentricity and the speed-ratio produces human-like behaviour. The heuristics can be used to animate avatars in virtual environments or to guide mobile robots. Combined with higher-level goal setting and way-finding behaviours, such navigation heuristics could provide the foundation for generative models of natural human locomotion.},

  Abstract                 = {Several systems discussed at this workshop on Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Non- equilibrium Complex Systems have been related to or analyzed in the context of the so-called Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGL). What is the difference between the physics underlying the usual amplitude description for stationary patterns and the one underlying the CGL? Why are there many more stable coherent structures [pulses, sources (holes), sinks] possible in systems described by the CGL than in systems exhibiting a stationary bifurcation, and what is their relation, if any, to the chaotic behavior that is characteristic of the CGL in some parameter regimes? The organizers of this workshop have asked me to try to provide some answers to these questions for the non-expert, someone with an interest in pattern formation but who has not had an introduction to the CGL before or who has not followed the recent developments in this field. Since there are several very recent review papers on this subject, where a more thorough and detailed discussion can be found, I will cofine myself here to a brief low-level introduction, in which I try to paint some of the main ideas with broad strokes. I stress that I do not pretend to give a balanced review | this chapter is extremely sketchy and coloured by my own interests, and I urge the reader interested in learning more about this line of research to consult the papers cited above and the references therein.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper aims to develop a model representing cluster perception in the distribution of point objects. Three spatial factors---that is, proximity, concentration, and density change---are considered to cause cluster perception. To measure these factors, two spatial notions based on the density of point objects are proposed: local density and relative local density. These densities are defined as the functions of a location in a map, and indicate how points are distributed around the location. Cluster perception is represented as a probabilistic function of the measures derived from the relative local density, and its likelihood is shown for model estimation. An experiment in cluster perception indicates that the model is significantly valid, and some empirical findings related to the heterogeneity of map readers in cluster perception are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a system of delay-differential equations modeling single-lane road traffic. The cars move in a closed circuit and the system s variables are each car s velocity and the distance to the car ahead. For low and high values of traffic density the system has a stable equilibrium solution, corresponding to the uniform flow. Gradually decreasing the density from high to intermediate values we observe a sequence of supercritical Hopf bifurcations forming multistable limit cycles, corresponding to flow regimes with periodically moving traffic jams. Using an asymptotic technique we find approximately small limit cycles born at Hopf bifurcations and numerically preform their global continuations with decreasing density. For sufficiently large delay the system passes to chaos following the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scenario (limit cycles-two-tori-three-tori-chaotic attractors). We find that chaotic and nonchaotic attractors coexist for the same parameter values and that chaotic attractors have a broad multifractal spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical investigations of escape panic of confined pedestrians have revealed interesting dynamical features such as pedestrian arch formation around an exit, disruptive interference, self-organized queuing, and scale-free behavior. However, these predictions have remained unverified because escape panic experiments with real systems are difficult to perform. For mice escaping out of a water pool, we found that for a critical sampling rate the escape behavior exhibits the predicted features even at short observation times. The mice escaped via an exit in bursts of different sizes that obey exponential and (truncated) power-law distributions depending on exit width. Oversampling or undersampling the mouse escape rate prevents the observation of the predicted features. Real systems are normally subject to unavoidable constraints arising from occupancy rate, pedestrian exhaustion, and nonrigidity of pedestrian bodies. The effect of these constraints on the dynamics of real escape panic is also studied.},

  abstract      = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book: Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials. Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls. Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications. Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds. Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

  abstract  = {When engineering distributed software systems based on self-organizing emergent solutions, assessing and understanding the relation between the microscopic dynamics and the resulting macroscopic behavior is a fundamental issue. In our research, we investigate a systematic approach for understanding the link between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, based on a numerical analysis technique called equation-free macroscopic analysis. Instead of deriving a (simplified) macroscopic model, equation-free methods only assume that such a model exists, and mimic a macroscopic simulation using only appropriately initialized simulations with the complete system.There are two crucial issues in this technique. The first issue is defining a complete set of macroscopic variables that would uniquely characterize the self-organizing emergent behavior in the solution. The second issue is the definition of a suitable initialization operator, that can create a good initial condition for the complete system, given only the values of the macroscopic variables. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach for the selection of macroscopic variables and the related initialization operator. We show how the equation-free approach can guide simulations to systematically increase understanding of the studied system. To illustrate the approach, we use a data clustering system inspired by termite nest building algorithms.},

For such time-dependent multi-scale problems, an "equation-free" framework has been proposed, of which patch dynamics is an essential component. Patch dynamics is designed to perform numerical simulations of an unavailable macroscopic equation on macroscopic time and length scales; it uses appropriately initialized simulations of the available microscopic model in a number of small boxes (patches), which cover only a fraction of the space-time domain. We show that it is possible to use arbitrary boundary conditions for these patches, provided that suitably large buffer regions "shield" the boundary artefacts from the interior of the patches. We analyze the accuracy of this scheme for a diffusion homogenization problem with periodic heterogeneity and illustrate the approach with a set of numerical examples, which include a non-linear reaction-diffusion equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.},

For this type of problems, an "equation-free" framework has recently been proposed. Using appropriately initialized fine-scale simulations, one can build a coarse time-stepper to approximate a time-stepper for the unavailable coarse model. Here, we use this coarse time-stepper to estimate matrix-vector products in a Jacobian-free Newton-GMRES method. The GMRES convergence is accelerated with a preconditioner that is derived from an approximate coarse equation. We examine the numerical properties of the approach with the computation of coarse traveling wave solutions of two lattice Boltzmann models for planar streamer fronts.},

If food locations, types and values are retained in memory, however, search time could be significantly reduced, with concurrent effects on biological fitness. Despite this, little is known about what specific characteristics of foods, particularly those relevant to profitability, nonhuman animals can remember. Building upon previous observations, we hypothesized that chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, after observing foods being hidden in a large wooded test area they could not enter, and after long delays, would direct (through gesture and vocalization) experimentally na\"{i}ve humans to the reward locations in an order that could be predicted beforehand by the spatial and physical characteristics of those items. In the main experiment, various quantities of almonds, both in and out of shells and sealed in transparent bags, were hidden in the test area. The chimpanzees later directed searchers to those items in a nonrandom order related to quantity, shell presence/absence, and the distance they were hidden from the subject. The recovery sequences were closely related to the actual e/h (energy/handling time) profitability of the foods. Predicted recovery orders, based on the energetic value of almonds and independently measured, individual-specific expected pursuit and processing times, were closely related to observed recovery orders. We argue that the information nonhuman animals possess regarding their environment can be extensive, and that further comparative study is vital for incorporating realistic cognitive variables into models of foraging and movement.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines the cognitive architecture of human action, showing how it is organized over several levels and how it is built up. Basic action concepts (BACs) are identified as major building blocks on a representation level. These \{BACs\} are cognitive tools for mastering the functional demands of movement tasks. Results from different lines of research showed that not only the structure formation of mental representations in long-term memory but also chunk formation in working memory are built up on \{BACs\} and relate systematically to movement structures. It is concluded that such movement representations might provide the basis for action implementation and action control in skilled voluntary movements in the form of cognitive reference structures. To simulate action implementation we discuss challenges and issues that arise when we try to replicate complex movement abilities in robots. Among the key issues to be addressed is the question how structured representations can arise during skill acquisition and how the underlying processes can be understood sufficiently succinctly to replicate them on robot platforms. Working towards this goal, we translate our findings in studies of motor control in humans into models that can guide the implementation of cognitive robot architectures. Focusing on the issue of manual action control, we illustrate some results in the context of grasping with a five-fingered anthropomorphic robot hand.},

It generalizes asymmetric exclusion models which have attracted a lot of interest in the past. The authors calculate the so-called fundamental diagram (flow versus density) for parallel dynamics using an improved mean-field approximation which takes into account short-range correlations. For maximum velocity they find that the simplest of these non-trivial approximations gives the exact result. For higher velocities their results are in excellent agreement with numerical data.},

It is assumed that the visual context (the arrangement of the distracting objects) is used to guide attention efficiently to the target location. Alternatively, other factors, e.g., facilitation in early visual processing or in response selection, may play a role as well. In a contextual cueing experiment, participant's electrophysiological brain activity was recorded. Participants identified the target faster and more accurately in repeatedly presented displays. In this condition, the N2pc, a component reflecting the allocation of visual-spatial attention, was enhanced, indicating that attention was allocated more efficiently to those targets. However, also response-related processes, reflected by the LRP, were facilitated, indicating that guidance of attention cannot account for the entire contextual cueing benefit.},

The issues included use of visual vs acoustic Ta information, use of acoustic Ta information by blind Ss, use of Ta information controlling for velocity, and effects of angle of approach and arrival time on judgment accuracy. Visual information was used more efficiently than audiovisual and auditory information. Blind Ss used acoustical approach information as accurately as sighted Ss used visual information. Radial, oblique, and transverse orientations were used to examine effects of approach trajectory. Radial events were underestimated, whereas the more accurate transverse approach was likely to be overestimated. Oblique angle events yielded intermediate accuracies implying a spatiotemporal anisotropy. Women underestimated Ta more than did men. Possible reasons for Ss' judgment accuracy, including linear vs nonlinear optical changes and relation to spatial skills and experience, were discussed.},

The 1st 3 studies demonstrated that Ss were more likely to respond to an intruder than to a service provider who interrupts the service for a specific amount of time even though waiting costs were manipulated to be identical in both situations. Results indicated that the queuer right behind the intrusion point has a special obligation to respond to the intrusion. In a field experiment, queuers were more likely to respond to an illegitimate than to a legitimate intrusion, and queuers' reactions were subject to social influence. Results suggest that the queue constitutes a social system. Future research and practical applications for the management of waiting queues are discussed.

  abstract = {The notion that visual attention can operate over visual objects in addition to spatial locations has recently received much empirical support, but there has been relatively little empirical consideration of what can count as an 'object' in the first place. We have investigated this question in the context of the multiple object tracking paradigm, in which subjects must track a number of independently and unpredictably moving identical items in a field of identical distractors. What types of feature clusters can be tracked in this manner? In other words, what counts as an 'object' in this task? We investigated this question with a technique we call target merging: we alter tracking displays so that distinct target and distractor locations appear perceptually to be parts of the same object by merging pairs of items (one target with one distractor) in various ways -- for example, by connecting item locations with a simple line segment, by drawing the convex hull of the two items, and so forth. The data show that target merging makes the tracking task far more difficult to varying degrees depending on exactly how the items are merged. The effect is perceptually salient, involving in some conditions a total destruction of subjects' capacity to track multiple items. These studies provide strong evidence for the object-based nature of tracking, confirming that in some contexts attention must be allocated to objects rather than arbitrary collections of features. In addition, the results begin to reveal the types of spatially organized scene components that can be independently attended as a function of properties such as connectedness, part structure, and other types of perceptual grouping.},

  title    = {Entwicklung eines individuenbasierten Modells zur Abbildung des Bewegungsverhaltens von Passagieren im Flughafenterminal},
  abstract = {Mit der Entwicklung eines stochastischen Modells zur Abbildung des Bewegungsverhal-tens von Passagieren wird die Basis fuer eine virtuelle Anwendungsumgebung geschaffen,mit der die Passagierabfertigungsprozesse im Flughafenterminal und die hierfuer notwen-digen Infrastrukturen modelliert, implementiert, untersucht und gezielt optimiert wer-den konnen. Es werden vorhandene wissenschaftliche Modellansaetze zur mikroskopischenAgentensimulation kritisch gewuerdigt und Anforderungen an das zu entwickelnde Bewe-gungsmodell abgeleitet. Das eigens entwickelte stochastische Bewegungsmodell stellt dieErweiterung eines raeumlich diskreten mikroskopischen Modells auf Basis eines zellularenAutomaten dar, wobei Defizite aufgrund der verwendeten diskreten Gitterstruktur bereitsauf Modellebene kompensiert werden. Zu den Erweiterungen zaehlen die autonome Umge-bungsanalyse und die Routenplanung des Agenten, die Abbildung weitreichender Wech-selwirkungen zwischen den Agenten und die Beruecksichtigung von gruppendynamischenEntscheidungen. Durch die Validierung des stochastischen Bewegungsmodells anhand desFundamentaldiagramms fuer Fussgaenger kann gezeigt werden, dass das Modell in der La-ge ist, den charakteristischen Verlauf der Geschwindigkeit in Relation zur Agentendichtequantitativ abzubilden. Auch typische, in der Realitaet beobachtbare Selbstorganisations-effekte konnen durch das Modell reproduziert werden.Fuer die Anwendung des stochastischen Modells zur Abbildung des Bewegungsverhal-tens von Passagieren im Flughafenterminal wird das Modell durch empirisch erhobenePassagierbewegungsdaten kalibriert. Die Datenerhebung erfolgt am Flughafen Dresdenunter Verwendung eines entwickelten videogestuetzten Bewegungsverfolgungssystems underlaubt eine gezielte Kalibrierung hinsichtlich der Passagierparameter: Geschlecht, Reise-motivation (privat oder geschaeftlich), Gruppengrosse sowie Gepaeckart und -anzahl. Fuerdie Erstellung der virtuellen Terminalumgebung werden die Passagierabfertigungsprozes-se eingehend analysiert und die Prozesszeiten der jeweiligen Abfertigungsstationen durchspezifische Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen modelliert. Hierfuer stehen empirische Date-nerhebungen am Flughafen Stuttgart zur Verfuegung, die eine detaillierte Prozessanalysehinsichtlich der Passagierparameter und der Prozessparameter (Erfahrung des Personals,Reaktionszeiten bei Storungen) erlauben.Im Anschluss an die Kalibrierung des stochastischen Bewegungsmodells und die Model-lierung der Passagierabfertigungsprozesse erfolgt die Entwicklung einer Anwendungsum-gebung fuer die Implementierung des virtuellen Flughafens. Durch den modularen Aufbau der Anwendungsumgebung ist eine effiziente Implementierung der Flughafenstrukturen(Grundriss, Flugplan, Personaleinsatz), der Abfertigungsprozesse und des stochastischenBewegungsmodells moglich. Die Anwendungsumgebung stellt dabei einen uebergeordnetenRahmen dar, durch den eine allgemeine Nutzerschnittstelle (Konfigurationsumgebung),eine grafische Ergebnisaufbereitung und die dreidimensionale Abbildung des Bewegungs-verhaltens der Passagiere zur Verfuegung steht.Die Anwendung des entwickelten stochastischen Bewegungsmodells erfolgt fuer die Va-lidierung der Passagierabfertigungsprozesse (Check-In und Sicherheitskontrolle), fuer dieEntwicklung einer passagierbezogener Prozessbewertung und fuer die vollstaendige Abbil-dung der Terminalprozesse (Abflug) am Beispiel des Flughafens Dresden. Durch die Ana-lyse des Einstiegsverhaltens der Passagiere in ein Verkehrsflugzeug werden die Notwendig-keit des Einsatzes stochastischer Bewegungsmodelle und das Potential mikroskopischerModellierungsansaetze verdeutlicht. Das entwickelte stochastische Bewegungsmodell kanndas Passagierverhalten auch in komplexen Umgebungen umfaenglich widerspiegeln und dieentwickelte Anwendungsumgebung stellt einen idealen Rahmen fuer die Modellanwendungund -weiterentwicklung dar. Durch die anwendungsorientierten Implementierungen stehteine Vielzahl von geeigneten Detaillosungen zur Verfuegung, um den zukuenftigen wissen-schaftlichen und praxisrelevanten Herausforderungen der Personendynamik zu begegnen.},

Natural discretization of pedestrian movement in continuous space - Notes

Idea: movement is modelled as circle around the person.
Validation: compare to known density vs. velocity diagrams and compare with evacuation experiment.

I. INTRODUCTION

- So far: pedestrian movement is modelled by cellular automata.

 +---+---+
 | | |
 +---+---+
 | | |
 +---+---+
 
 Drawbacks (differs from real life):
 * Each pedestrian has equal size, i.e. the size of one cell.
 * No arbitrary direction possible, i.e. only horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
 
- Better approach: social force models in continuous space and time.
 -> Inspired by Newtonian mechanics.
 -> High densities => dynamics is dominated by physical mechanisms, e.g. narrowed streets.
 -> Low densities => dynamics is dominated by cognitive heuristics.
- Goals:
 * Combine both aspects.
 * Maintain stepwise movement of cellular automata
 * Do not use a spatial grid.
 
II. MODEL

- Circle around each pedestrian.
- Each pedestrian is driven by desired speed and direction.
 -> Speed is fixed attribute of pedestrian but can be increased/decreased.
- After each time step, pedestrians are informed how much time has elapsed.
- Two potentials:
 1. Attractive: pedestrian's target has an attractive potential.
 2. Repulsive:
 * Other pedestrians have a weighted repulsive potential which depends on the Euclidean distance.
 -> For simplicity, use same weight for each pedestrian. * Obstacles have a repulsive potential.
 -> Use higher weight than for pedestrians (10,000 vs. 1,000).
- At each time, potential for every point in plane can be calculated.
 -> A function P(x) which sums up pedestrian's and obstacle's repulsive potentials.
- Idea: this function defines the next step of a pedestrian on "his" circle.
 * Use P (paper states -P because it is interpreted as utility function and we want to maximize utility).
 * Use gradient descent methods to calculate next step, i.e. the minimum.
 * Optimize locally by using a greedy algorithm w/o planning further steps.
 * The floor field carries global information to avoid traps.
- Pedestrian's circle is discretized.
 -> Noise positions in each step to avoid artefacts.
- Positions are updated sequentially.
 -> Effect of sequential updates disappear if simulation time step goes to zero.
 
III. EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF STEP LENGTHS

- Setup:
 * Distance of 12 m.
 * Three regimes: walk, jog and run.
- Results:
 * At first, step length increases linearly with speed until 4 m/s.
 * Then, step length slows down.
 
IV. DENSITY-SPEED RELATION

- Validate model against known density-speed relations.
- First, velocity of each pedestrian is measured and then the density is calculated (= average )
 -> Density is calculated by using Voronoi diagrams.
- Simulation shows identical density vs. speed diagrams compared to Weidmann's diagrams => model is valid.
 -> But, simulation shows a systematically faster approach to slower velocity than Weidmann.
 => Therefore, to better fit real life, introduce local density.
 
V. SIMULATION STUDY AT A BOTTLENECK

Skip this section because it is not so relevant according to Micheal Seitz.

VI. CONCLUSION

- Introduced grid-free trajectories which is a better approach for real-life situations.

crowds. This can enhance crowd safety at large events and transport hubs, and increase efficiency such

observations, not an understanding of human decision making. Theories of crowd psychology can
elucidate the factors underpinning collective behavior in human crowds. Yet, in contrast to psychology,
computer science must rely upon mathematical formulations in order to implement algorithms and keep
models manageable. Here, we address the problems and possible solutions encountered when incorporating
social psychological theories of collective behavior in computer modeling. We identify that one
primary issue is retaining parsimony in a model while avoiding reductionism by excluding necessary
aspects of crowd psychology, such as the behavior of groups. We propose cognitive heuristics as a
potential avenue to create a parsimonious model that incorporates core concepts of collective behavior
derived from empirical research in crowd psychology.},

  abstract  = {Abstract India has witnessed higher level of mobility at urban as well as intercity segments due to improvisation of socio-economic conditions in last two decades. Even though, majority of the intercity travel is made by road based modes, number of passengers traveling by railways is significant on certain highly industrialized corridors. Collection and dispersal of passengers on railway platforms take place through stairways and foot over bridges. Design of these vital elements needs to incorporate the behavior of pedestrian flow to ensure desired level of service as well as safety in case of emergency. As reported in literature, pedestrian flow characteristics are influenced by number of attributes of pedestrian like age, gender, physical dimensions, luggage carried, group size, activity while walking, purpose in addition to the other attributes such as space availability, direction of movement and schedule of train as well. Very limited efforts are made in India to study pedestrian flow behavior in this context. Fluctuations in pedestrian flow depends on schedule of arrival and departure of the train, particularly during the peak hours as there is large passenger flow in short interval of time. Due to limited capacity of pedestrian facility, especially staircases, desired speed cannot be achieved by the pedestrian while walking in crowd with luggage. Higher walking speed is reported on downstairs than upstairs with reduction in speed with increase in pedestrian density. Most of the pedestrian facilities are designed by rule of thumb, especially stairways, largely governed by ideal pedestrian behavior. However behavior of individual pedestrian and hence flow at rail transit stations are dynamic on stairways depending on the factors mentioned above. Present study attempts to highlight the results of the study carried out on pedestrian flow behavior at Vadodara railway station in the state of Gujarat, India. Total 3411 number of pedestrian data are extracted by employing videographic technique. Flow models of speed- flow, speed-density and flow-density are developed to illustrate behaviour of pedestrian stream on stairways of different dimensions.},

3411 pedestrians, extracted from recorded video on one minute interval basis.
Pedestrian moving in group are observed to talk with each other by matching their walking
speed. Such group of pedestrian affects the whole pedestrian flow.
Presence of luggage has influence on average walking speed range on stairs.
Speed vs. density plots (p. 7).
Lower speed variation in high densities.
Speed decreases with gradual increase in density. But also observered: almost flatter and
parallel trend with less difference in speed against large variation in density.
Pedestrian walk faster during afternoon or day time compared to evening.
For different sizes of staircase different trends but with general similar pattern.

We validate this finding, and also extend it, by examining the extent to which sound can also be understood as instrumental in intergroup relations. We interviewed nine members of a Catholic enclave in predominantly Protestant East Belfast about their experiences of an outgroup (Orange Order) parade, where intrusive sound was a feature. Participants reported experiencing the sounds as a manifestation of the Orange Order identity and said that it made them feel threatened and anxious because they felt it was targeted at them by the outgroup (e.g., through aggressive volume increases). There was also evidence that the sounds produced community disempowerment, which interviewees explicitly linked to the invasiveness of the music. Some interviewees described organizing to collectively drown out the bands sounds, an activity which appeared to be uplifting. These findings develop the elaborated social identity model of empowerment, by showing that intergroup struggle and collective self-objectification can operate through sound as well as through physical actions.},

During the design and operation stages, modeling of the metro station evacuation capacity by using the computational models is an effective measure for guaranteeing the metro evacuation safety in the future. In this article, the safety strategy of evacuation in metro stations is first investigated and established, which involves the occupants needed to be evacuated, the evacuation route, and the safety zone. Then, an engineering calculation method for the metro station evacuation time is proposed. Based on the experimental data, simulation of evacuation process in different fire cases is conducted by using an agent-based model, so as to study the features of occupant evacuation behavior, the evacuation time, the passage flow rate, and the strategy of using the escalator as evacuation passage. These conclusions will be helpful for guiding the safe evacuation design of metros in China.},

We introduce the nonlinear velocity obstacle, which takes into account the shape, velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. The nonlinear v-obstacle allows selecting a single avoidance maneuver (if one exists) that avoids any number of obstacles moving on any known trajectories. For unknown trajectories, the nonlinear v-obstacles can be used to generate local avoidance maneuvers based on the current velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. This elevates the planning strategy to a second order method, compared to the first order avoidance using the linear v-obstacle, and zero order avoidance using only position information.

  abstract = {Collective movement is important during emergencies such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, when rapid egress is essential for escape. The development of quantitative theories and models to explain and predict the collective dynamics of pedestrians has been hindered by the lack of complementary data under emergency conditions. Collective patterns are not restricted to humans, but have been observed in other non-human biological systems. In this study, a mathematical model for crowd panic is derived from collective animal dynamics. The development and validation of the model is supported by data from experiments with panicking Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). A first attempt is also made to scale the model parameters for collective pedestrian traffic from those for ant traffic, by employing a scaling concept approach commonly used in biology.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that a comprehensive approach to crowd safety design, management and risk assessment needs to integrate psychology and engineering frames of reference. Psychology and engineering are characteristically mutually exclusive in their focus on the perspective of crowd rnembers who think and behat, e (psychology) or on static and dynamic objects (engineering). Engineering places as much emphasis on the physical environment as psychology negates the relationship between the physical environment and people. This paper stresses the need to address the relationship between (A) design and engineering (B) communications technology x(C) crowd managementx(D) crowd behaviour and movement. Theories of crowd psychology are briefly reviewed with particular reference to crowd ingress and egress and misconceptions about 'panic' or irrational behaviour. Assumptions about panic reinforce an emphasis on the control of a crowd, as if a crowd is a homogeneous mass of bodies or 'ballbearings', rather than the management of a crowd as a collection of individuals and social groups who need accurate and timely information if they are to remain sale. Particular emphasis is put on the fact that the time Ibr a crowd to escape from a sittlation of potential entrapment is a function of T ( Time to escape) = t~ ( time to start to move) + t2 ( time to move to and pass through exits), rather than T= t2. This is illustrated by reference to research of escape behaviour in the Summerland fire and underground station evacuations. The paper concludes by stressi.ng the need to validate computer simulations of crowd movement and escape behaviour against psychological as well as engineering criteria.},

  abstract = {Abstract Estimating count and density maps from crowd images has a wide range of applications such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public safety and urban planning. In addition, techniques developed for crowd counting can be applied to related tasks in other fields of study such as cell microscopy, vehicle counting and environmental survey. The task of crowd counting and density map estimation is riddled with many challenges such as occlusions, non-uniform density, intra-scene and inter-scene variations in scale and perspective. Nevertheless, over the last few years, crowd count analysis has evolved from earlier methods that are often limited to small variations in crowd density and scales to the current state-of-the-art methods that have developed the ability to perform successfully on a wide range of scenarios. The success of crowd counting methods in the recent years can be largely attributed to deep learning and publications of challenging datasets. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches that have demonstrated significant improvements over earlier methods that rely largely on hand-crafted representations. First, we briefly review the pioneering methods that use hand-crafted representations and then we delve in detail into the deep learning-based approaches and recently published datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and drawbacks of existing CNN-based approaches and identify promising avenues of research in this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract  = {We present a Galerkin-free, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-assisted computational methodology for numerical simulations of the long-term dynamics of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The approach is based on the "equation-free" framework: we use short, appropriate initialized bursts of full direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations to observe, estimate, and accelerate, through "projective integration", the evolution of the flow dynamics. The main assumption is that the long-term dynamics of the flow lie on a low-dimensional, attracting, and invariant manifold, which can be parametrized, not necessarily spanned, by a few POD basis functions. We start with a discussion of the consistency and accuracy of the approach, and then illustrate it through numerical examples: two-dimensional periodic and quasi-periodic flows past a circular cylinder. We demonstrate that the approach can successfully resolve complex flow dynamics at a reduced computational cost and that it can capture the long-term asymptotic state of the flow in cases where traditional Galerkin-POD models fail. The approach trades the overhead involved in developing POD-Galerkin and POD-nonlinear Galerkin codes, for the repeated (yet short, and on demand) use of an existing full DNS simulator. Moreover, since in this approach the POD modes are used to observe rather than span the true system dynamics, the computation is much less sensitive than POD-Galerkin to values of the system parameters (e.g., the Reynolds number) and the particular simulation data ensemble used to obtain the POD basis functions.},

  abstract  = {Crowds are composed of both single persons and small to large groups of people. A family can
be considered a special group within a crowd because of its unique behaviour. While families may become
separated at the beginning of an emergency situation, they tend to evacuate the situation together. That is,
according to ndings in psychology, family members search for each other and evacuate once they are reunited.
However, it is not exceptional that families are separated at the beginning of an emergency. According to
psychological ndings, family members search for each other and evacuate after they are reunited. The model
presented in this paper transfers these ndings into pedestrian evacuation simulation. We describe how we
model the behaviour of separated families and qualitatively validate the model. With the help of uncertainty
quantication and Sobol indices, we analyse the impact of three uncertain parameters of the model on the
evacuation times: the percentage of family members in the crowd, the speed at which parents search for their
children, and the speed of the children evacuating with their parents. As a result, we can show that it is vital
to consider families in evacuation simulation to better estimate of the evacuation times.},

  abstract = {Die Simulation von Personenstr\"omen hat sich mittlerweile zu einer anerkannten Methode entwickelt, um Geb\"audepl\"ane zu verbessern und Sicherheit bei Veranstaltungen zu gew\"ahrleisten.
In den letzten Jahrzehnten wurden daher viele neue Modelle f\"ur die Bewegung von Personen und Menschenmengen entwickelt. 
Die meisten dieser Modelle liefern gute Ergebnisse, solange der Fokus der Betrachtung auf der physikalischen Bewegung liegt. 
Andererseits wurden jedoch soziale Verhaltensweisen bislang weitgehend ignoriert, obwohl diese das Gesamtverhalten in einer Evakuierung beeinflussen.

Die Entwicklung und Auspr\"agungen solcher sozialer Verhaltensweisen wurden von Sozialpsychologen intensiv durch empirische Studien untersucht und in Theorien zusammengefasst. 
Allerdings ist ein Gro{\ss}teil dieser psychologischen Modelle nur verbal beschrieben und besitzt eine sehr komplexe Struktur mit vielen Eingangsparametern. 
Deshalb fehlen soziale Verhaltensweisen meist in Evakuierungsmodellen, womit entsprechenden Simulationen ein wesentlicher Bestandteil zur tats\"achlichen Abbildung der Realit\"at fehlt.

In dieser interdisziplin\"aren Arbeit werden gut erforschte sozialpsychologische Theorien in mathematische und algorithmische Verhaltensmodelle \"uberf\"uhrt. 
Diese neuen Modelle werden mit einem ausf\"uhrlich validierten Fortbewegungsmodell f\"ur Fu{\ss}g\"anger kombiniert und im Forschungssimulator VADERE der Hochschule M\"unchen implementiert. 
Sie bleiben nahe an den sozialpsychologischen Theorien, behalten dabei jedoch einen \"uberschaubaren Parameterraum. 
Die virtuellen Fu{\ss}g\"anger zeigen in den durchgef\"uhrten Simulationen das erwartete, in der Realit\"at beobachtete Verhalten. 
So gelingt durch diese neuen Modelle ein entscheidender Schritt in Richtung realistischere und vertrauensw\"urdigere Simulationen von Personenstr\"omen.},

  Abstract                 = {According to optimal distinctiveness theory (ODT; Brewer 1991), individuals prefer social groups that are relatively distinct compared to other groups in the individuals' social environment. Distinctive groups (i.e., groups of moderate relative size) are deemed "optimal" because they allow for feelings of inclusion and social connection while simultaneously providing a basis for differentiating the self from others. However, ODT is a theory about individual preferences and, as such, does not address the important question of what types of groups are actually formed as a function of these individual-level preferences for groups of a certain size. The goal of the current project was to address this gap and provide insight into how the nature of the social environment (e.g., the size of the social neighborhood) interacts with individual-level group size preferences to shape group formation. To do so, we developed an agent-based model in which agents adopted a social group based on an optimal group size preference (e.g., a group whose size represented 20\% of the social neighborhood). We show that the assumptions of optimal distinctiveness theory do not lead to individually satisfactory outcomes when all individuals share the same social environment. We were able to produce results similar to those predicted by ODT when social neighborhoods were local and overlapping. These results suggest that the effectiveness of a social identity decision strategy is highly dependent on sociospatial structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Insects are able to navigate reliably between food and nest using only visual information. This behavior has inspired many models of visual landmark guidance, some of which have been tested on autonomous robots. The majority of these models work by comparing the agent's current view with a view of the world stored when the agent was at the goal. The region from which agents can successfully reach home is therefore limited to the goal's visual locale, that is, the area around the goal where the visual scene is not radically different to the goal position. Ants are known to navigate over large distances using visually guided routes consisting of a series of visual memories. Taking inspiration from such route navigation, we propose a framework for linking together local navigation methods. We implement this framework on a robotic platform and test it in a series of environments in which local navigation methods fail. Finally, we show that the framework is robust to environments of varying complexity.},

To chart this process of behavioral confirmation, we observed successive interactions between one target and two perceivers. In the first interaction, targets who interacted with perceivers who anticipated hostile partners displayed greater behavioral hostility than targets whose perceivers expected nonhostile partners. Only when targets regarded their actions as reflections of personal dispositions did these behavioral differences in hostility persevere into their subsequent interactions with naive perceivers who had no prior knowledge about them. Theoretical implications of the behavioral confirmation construct for social perception processes are discussed.},

Either immediately after reading the case history or 1 wk later, some participants learned that she was currently living a lesbian life-style; others learned that she was currently living a heterosexual life-style; still others learned nothing about her life-style. The impact of this new information on recognition memory for factual events in Betty K.'s life was assessed 1 wk after reading the case history. Ss selectively affirmed events that supported and bolstered their current interpretations of Betty K. Performance was the same whether Ss learned this information immediately after reading the case history or 1 wk later. Additional evidence suggests that these results are best characterized as the product of an interaction between stereotyped beliefs about sexuality and genuine memory for factual events. Implications of these findings for the nature, function, and consequences of social knowledge are discussed},

  abstract = {The assignment of distributed mobile autonomous robots to targets, which occurs for instance as an important task in flexible manufac- turing environments, is solved by using a self-organization approach motivated by pattern formation principles in biological, chemical, and physical systems. Similar to observations in many natural systems, such as ant tribes, the pattern formation of colored shells or convection patterns in the Rayleigh?B?nard problem of fluid dynamics, the self-organization principles lead to a robust and fault tolerant behavior where the patterns or structures recover from disturbances. The considered problem is the dynamic assignment of a number of robots to given targets where the mobile robots have to move to the targets in order to perform some tasks there. Hereby, each robot uses only local information (i.e., no world coordinate system is necessary). The underlying mathematical problem of the robot?target assignment is the so-called two-index assignment problem from combinatorial optimization. The approach used guarantees always feasible solutions in the assignment of robotic units to targets. As a consequence, for scenarios with only convex obstacles with large enough distances to each other, no spurious states cause the assignment process to fail. The error resistant control method for distributed autonomous robotic systems is demonstrated by several experiments with mobile robots. These results are compared and supplemented with computer simulations.},

  abstract  = {Severe accidents with many fatalities have occurred when too many pedestrians had to maneuver in too tight surroundings, as during evacuations of mass events. This demonstrates the importance of a better general understanding of pedestrians and emergent complex behavior in crowds. To this end, we develop both a new microscopic agent-based pedestrian model and also study simplified evacuation scenarios which permit the isolation of relevant nonlinear effects and their systematic investigation. We concentrate on two effects: First, the influence of the position and size of an obstacle in front of an emergency exit on the flux through the exit, and second, the influence of other pedestrians on the route choice of an individual. The first investigation demonstrates the possibility of improving substantially the flow through an exit by placing an obstacle in a suitable way in front of it. The latter shows clearly bistable states and hysteresis effects, indicating the existence of unstable pedestrian flow states in addition to the stable states. Furthermore, this set-up is an example of a radical change of the pedestrian flux by only a small change in the geometry of the evacuation scenario. The results motivate further investigation and eventually engineering use by optimizing the design of large buildings, stations, airports and stadiums for mass events.},

Many tools for pedestrian planning are based on cellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time, some use self driven pargticles (SDP), continuous in space and time. It is common experience that CA have problems with modelling sharp bends in wide corridors. They tend to move the pedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby reducing the capacity of the facility. With SDP, the problem seems to be less pronounced but still present. With CA, we compare the performance of two standard shortest distance based static floors on 90 and 180 degree bends with a newly defined one. For SDP, we demonstrate how variations in the modeling of the momentary destination of the agents influence trajectories and capacity.},

  abstract  = {One major business of civil aviation is to carry passengers between airports while providing
good customer services at low costs. The turn time of an airplane, i.e. broadly speaking, the
time that an airplane is on ground, is crucial for its utilisation and thus for the airlines profitability.
From this it follows, that the turn time needs to be as short as possible.
In this paper we analyse various actions (inside and outside the airplane) to reduce the boarding
time and hence the turn time. These actions were investigated with a specifically developed
simulation tool (the Airplane Boarding Simulator (ABS)), and cover the whole process from
(and including) the gate until the passengers arrive at their seats.
The simulation model was calibrated by using video data from observations of eight boardings
at Zurich airport. The primary goal was to determine the impact of the following factors on the
boarding time: (i) number of pieces of hand luggage, (ii) pre-boarding area (and timing), (iii)
boarding (seating) strategy inside the airplane, (iv) procedures at the gate desk (power-boarding,
additional staff).
Based on the experiences on-site and the results of the simulations we found, that with a reduced
number of pieces of hand luggage, the use of a pre-boarding area and an appropriate
boarding (seating) strategy, a reduction of the boarding time of around four minutes for airplanes
of similar size than the Airbus A321 is possible. Moreover, we outline feasible actions
that could lead to further improvements. In any case, a good coordination of the actions taken is
of crucial importance, together with an appropriate training of the staff (airplane crew and
ground) and a clear and easy to understand information of the passengers.},

  abstract = {In contemporary sociological and social psychological theory and research an increasing amount of attention has been  given to the functioning of small groups.' Many attempts have been made to analyze the interaction that takes place in small group meetings and to discover general principles that appear to determine, or at least influence, the pattern of participation by the  various members of the group. The research reported here is devoted to one of the basic aspects of small group research, namely the relative frequency of participation. Specifically, this study concerns the application of a relatively simple mathematical function that appears to express quite well the distribution of participation within a particular type of small discussion group. In a recent paper, Bales suggested that a harmonic distribution might serve to approximate the relative frequency of acts of participation among members of small problem- solving groups. The results he obtained, however, indicated that this approximation is not close enough to be fully satisfactory and, for this reason, he concluded that a more complicated model may be necessary for greater precision. The proven inadequacy of the harmonic model, however, does not necessitate the use of models of great complexity. A model of comparable simplicity is available which appears to provide a very good representation of data obtained from a variety of small discussion groups. It is a simple exponential model, that had previously been applied by one of the authors to another study of group participation. When it was applied to Bales' published data, it provided a good fit.4 This paper is primarily  concerned with the general adequacy of this exponential model for representing other sets of participation  data.},

This was investigated in five ticket halls in the London Underground. Queues, groups of people using automatic ticket machines, and other types of static groups were observed. The location of these groups was related to the layout of the space, and their general effects on movement through the space were assessed. It was found that under certain conditions static groups impede movement and diminish the effective width of key movoment channels. Although the study was exploratory, the results suggest a number of ways in which the layout of certain types of space might be optimized in terms of the criteria considered.},

Despite single dogs solving this {\textquoteleft}shepherding problem{\textquoteright} every day, it remains unknown which algorithm they employ or whether a general algorithm exists for shepherding. Here, we demonstrate such an algorithm, based on adaptive switching between collecting the agents when they are too dispersed and driving them once they are aggregated. Our algorithm reproduces key features of empirical data collected from sheep{\textendash}dog interactions and suggests new ways in which robots can be designed to influence movements of living and artificial agents.},

  abstract = {Summary Social transmission of information is vital for many group-living animals, allowing coordination of motion and effective response to complex environments. Revealing the interaction networks underlying information flow within these groups is a central challenge [1]. Previous work has modeled interactions between individuals based directly on their relative spatial positions: each individual is considered to interact with all neighbors within a fixed distance (metric range [2]), a fixed number of nearest neighbors (topological range [3]), a 'shell' of near neighbors (Voronoi range [4]), or some combination (Figure 1A). However, conclusive evidence to support these assumptions is lacking. Here, we employ a novel approach that considers individual movement decisions to be based explicitly on the sensory information available to the organism. In other words, we consider that while spatial relations do inform interactions between individuals, they do so indirectly, through individuals' detection of sensory cues. We reconstruct computationally the visual field of each individual throughout experiments designed to investigate information propagation within fish schools (golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas). Explicitly considering visual sensing allows us to more accurately predict the propagation of behavioral change in these groups during leadership events. Furthermore, we find that structural properties of visual interaction networks differ markedly from those of metric and topological counterparts, suggesting that previous assumptions may not appropriately reflect information flow in animal groups.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern cognitive psychology has strictly adhered to the experimental methodology of the natural sciences. Often, contributions in Theory & Psychology have addressed shortcomings and possible remedies of this predominant approach and its emphasis on `effects'. My comment contrasts this approach with the generative theories (cognitive simulation models) developed in cognitive science about 30 years ago and still not widely accepted in psychology. I characterize these generative theories, and discuss their weaknesses and their advantages over the usual way of theorizing in cognitive psychology. I hope to convince at least some readers that (a) in order to proceed in this manner, you need not buy a ready-made `cognitive architecture', and (b) that this approach results in a much more rigorous theorizing (although still well controllable as a scientific endeavor).},

We introduce a new data structure, Multi-agent Navigation Graph (MaNG), which is constructed using first- and second-order Voronoi diagrams. The MaNG is used to perform route planning and proximity computations for each agent in real time. Moreover, we use the path information and proximity relationships for local dynamics computation of each agent by extending a social force model [Helbing05]. We compute the MaNG using graphics hardware and present culling techniques to accelerate the computation. We also address undersampling issues and present techniques to improve the accuracy of our algorithm. Our algorithm is used for real-time multi-agent planning in pursuit-evasion, terrain exploration and crowd simulation scenarios consisting of hundreds of moving agents, each with a distinct goal.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

This study has proved itself uniquely interdisciplinary, involving physicists, mathematicians, engineers as well as biologists. Almost all experimental work in this area is related directly or indirectly to mathematical models, with regular movement back and forth between models, experimental data and statistical fitting. In this paper, we describe how the modelling cycle works in the study of collective animal behaviour. We classify studies as addressing questions at different levels or linking different levels, i.e. as local, local to global, global to local or global. We also describe three distinct approaches{\textemdash}theory-driven, data-driven and model selection{\textemdash}to these questions. We show, with reference to our own research on species across different taxa, how we move between these different levels of description and how these various approaches can be applied to link levels together.},

  Abstract                 = {With an increase in the scale of industrial operations the necessity of understanding the behaviour of granular materials and examining their properties
becomes increasingly important. It is associated with rapid development of industries such as: food, chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic etc., in
which materials in granular form are processed. One way of description of macroscopic behaviour of granular systems is a model including interactions
between individual particles and between particle and elements of construction. Current needs of both technology and science call for the new research
methods that provide more accurate results and enable closer examination of processes. Development of computational techniques resulted in the
elaboration of Discrete Element Method (DEM).
This article is focused on DEM as proposed by Cundall & Strack [1979] which enables interpretation of processes occurring in granular bedding
considering phenomena on interparticle scale. The limitations and capabilities of DEM as well as results of modelling experimental investigations are
addressed.},

  abstract  = {Signal processing methods have significantly changed over the last several decades. Traditional methods were usually based on parametric statistical inference and linear filters. These frameworks have helped to develop efficient algorithms that have often been suitable for implementation on digital signal processing (DSP) systems. Over the years, DSP systems have advanced rapidly, and their computational capabilities have been substantially increased. This development has enabled contemporary signal processing algorithms to incorporate more computations. Consequently, we have recently experienced a growing interaction between signal processing and machine-learning approaches, e.g., Bayesian networks, graphical models, and kernel-based methods, whose computational burden is usually high.},

The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy regarding the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight regarding the possible application of the microscopic pedestrian model. The microscopic pedestrian model was developed and the microscopic pedestrian data validated it. Although the model is very simple, it shows the lane formation, self-organization phenomena as seen in the real world. Three microscopic simulation scenarios were developed. The first scenario compares one-way and two-way pedestrian traffic to gain more understanding about their characteristics. The second scenario is to know the behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases. The third scenario proposes a policy of lane-like segregation towards pedestrian crossing and inspects the performance of the crossing.},

If the number of occupants in the building is only small, then the shortest paths to the exits may enable all the occupants to evacuate in minimum possible time. Previous studies have shown, however, that the shortest path configuration does not lead to minimum egress time for large crowds in public facilities such as those in a school, theater or gym. We extend the previous studies by determining the minimum egress time for different crowd sizes on a fixed network graph. We apply optimization search on a mesoscopic multi-agent pedestrian simulation that employs the concept of Route-Choice Self-Organization (RCSO). We show that the egress time gap between the shortest path configuration and RCSO configuration increases very quickly with respect to crowd size. Thus, for crowded pedestrian facilities, there may be a need to revise the standard evacuation map so that evacuation behavior that approximates the RCSO becomes possible, and this can lead to a much better egress time.},

We critically examine the crowd modeling literature and call for future simulations of crowd behavior to be based more closely on findings from current social psychological research. A systematic review was conducted on the crowd modeling literature (N = 140 articles) to identify the assumptions about crowd behavior that modelers use in their simulations. Articles were coded according to the way in which crowd structure was modeled. It was found that 2 broad types are used: mass approaches and small group approaches. However, neither the mass nor the small group approaches can accurately simulate the large collective behavior that has been found in extensive empirical research on crowd events. We argue that to model crowd behavior realistically, simulations must use methods which allow crowd members to identify with each other, as suggested by self-categorization theory.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

However, the adaptive benefit of arboreal bipedalism has been unknown. Here we show that it allows the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, to access supports too flexible to be negotiated otherwise. Orangutans react to branch flexibility like humans running on springy tracks, by increasing knee and hip extension, whereas all other primatesdothe reverse. Human bipedalism is thus less an innovation than an exploitation of a locomotor behavior retained from the common great ape ancestor.},

  Abstract                 = {How can anyone be rational in a world where knowledge is limited, time is pressing, and deep thought is often an unattainable luxury? Traditional models of unbounded rationality and optimization in cognitive science, economics, and animal behavior have tended to view decision-makers as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and endless time. But understanding decisions in the real world requires a more psychologically plausible notion of bounded rationality. In Simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), we explore fast and frugal heuristics - simple rules in the mind's adaptive toolbox for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments. In this pr\'{e}cis, we show how simple building blocks that control information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization, and satisficing heuristics for sequential search. These simple heuristics perform comparably to more complex algorithms, particularly when generalizing to new data - that is, simplicity leads to robustness. We present evidence regarding when people use simple heuristics and describe the challenges to be addressed by this research program.},

For example, a queue of vehicles with appropriate headway (or density) alleviates traffic jams since the delay of reaction to start is minimized. In this paper, we have investigated the fundamental relation between the propagation speed of a starting wave and the initial density by both our mathematical model built on the stochastic cellular automata and experimental measurements. Analysis of our mathematical model implies that the relation is characterized by a power law and the experimental results verify this feature. Moreover, when the starting wave is characterized by the power law we have revealed the existence of optimal density, where the required time, i.e., the sum of the waiting time until the starting wave reaches the last pedestrian in a queue and his/her travel time to pass the head position of the initial queue, is minimized. This optimal density inevitably plays a significant role in achieving a smooth movement of crowds and vehicles in a queue.},

The paper investigates the propagation speed of pedestrians reactions in the relaxation process of a queue, the so-called starting wave, toward a smooth movement of crowds since a fast starting wave achieves a high departure rate. The authors propose a mathematical model, a stochastic cellular automaton models with a headway-dependent hopping prob- ability. A special relation between the propagation speed of pedestrians reactions and the initial density is found, which is well approximated by a power law that contains the arrival rate and the service rate and the density.

The analysis is done in controllable systems where the density is homogeneous and all the characteristics are known. The objectives are to estimate the global density with local measurements or density profile at high spatial resolution with no bias and low fluctuations. The classical estimation using discrete numbers of observed pedestrians is compared to continuous estimators using spacing distance, Voronoi diagram, Gaussian kernel as well as maximum likelihood. Mean squared error and bias of the estimators are calculated from empirical data and Monte Carlo experiments. The results show quantitatively how continuous approaches improve the precision of the estimations.},

  Abstract                 = {Animal groups in nature often display an enhanced collective information-processing capacity. It has been speculated that natural selection will tune this response to be optimal, ensuring that the group is reactive while also being robust to noise. Here, we show that this is unlikely to be the case. By using a simple model of decision-making in a dynamic environment, we find that when individuals behave rationally and are subject to selection based on their accuracy, optimality of collective decision-making is not attained. Instead, individuals overly rely on social information and evolve to be too readily influenced by their neighbours. This is due to a classic evolutionary conflict between individual and collective interest. The result is a sub-optimal system that is poised on the cusp of total unresponsiveness. Individuals in the evolved group exhibit delayed reactions to changes in the environment, before responding with rapid, socially reinforced transitions, reminiscent of familiar human and animal social systems (markets, stampedes, fashions, etc.). Our results demonstrate that behaviour of this type may not be pathological, but instead could represent an evolutionary attractor for such collective systems.},

  abstract = {Human movement is a significant ingredient of many social, environmental, and technical systems, yet the importance of movement is often discounted in considering systems' complexity. Movement is commonly abstracted in agent-based modeling (which is perhaps the methodological vehicle for modeling complex systems), despite the influence of movement upon information exchange and adaptation in a system. In particular, agent-based models of urban pedestrians often treat movement in proxy form at the expense of faithfully treating movement behavior with realistic agency. There exists little consensus about which method is appropriate for representing movement in agent-based schemes. In this paper, we examine popularly-used methods to drive movement in agent-based models, first by introducing a methodology that can flexibly handle many representations of movement at many different scales and second, introducing a suite of tools to benchmark agent movement between models and against real-world trajectory data. We find that most popular movement schemes do a relatively poor job of representing movement, but that some schemes may well be ``good enough'' for some applications. We also discuss potential avenues for improving the representation of movement in agent-based frameworks.},

Recent research provides new insights into its nature and function. Like the "basic" emotions, pride is associated with a distinct, universally recognized, nonverbal expression, which is spontaneously displayed during pride experiences. Yet, pride differs from the basic emotions in its dependency on self-evaluations and in its complex structure, which is comprised of two theoretically and conceptually distinct facets that have divergent personality correlates and cognitive antecedents. In this article, we summarize findings from the growing body of research on pride and highlight the implications of this research for a broader understanding of emotions and social behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Examined the effects of perceptual grouping on search for targets defined by separate features or by conjunction of features. The author and G. Gelade (see record 1980-04685-001) proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. Four experiments, involving 46 high school or university students, confirmed these predictions. In search for conjunctions, Ss appeared to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate showed little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features appeared to be independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target could be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between 2 adjacent groups, each of which shared one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration.},

  Abstract                 = {Harry Triandis explores the constructs of collectivism and individualism. Collectivists are closely linked individuals who view themselves primarily as parts of a whole, be it a family, a network of co-workers, a tribe, or a nation. Such people are mainly motivated by the norms and duties imposed by the collective entity. Individualists are motivated by their own preferences, needs, and rights, giving priority to personal rather than to group goals.
Triandis challenges the view that psychology is universal, offering evidence for culture-specific influences on thought and action. We learn that the cultural patterns represented by individualism and collectivism lead people to view their worlds through different lenses, attaching different meanings to life events. Triandis explains how these variations in meaning can help us better understand why crime rates, divorce rates, levels of self-esteem, feelings of well-being, and indeed overall behavioral patterns can be so different from one society to another.}

  Abstract                 = {Der wesentlichste Einflussfaktor der Fahrgastwechselzeit im Personenfernverkehr ist das Fahrgastverhalten, welches durch die Charakteristik des Reisenden, wie Alter und / oder Mobilit{\"a}tseinschr{\"a}nkungen, die Gep{\"a}ckmitnahme und die Fahrzeuggestaltung bestimmt wird. Das Fahrgastverhalten spiegelt sich in erster Linie in der Betriebsqualit{\"a}t wider.
An Tagen mit gro{\ss}em Reiseaufkommen haben diese Gr{\"o}{\ss}en zur Folge, dass sich die Haltezeit erheblich verl{\"a}ngert. Daraus resultieren meist Versp{\"a}tungen, die sich wiederum auch auf andere Z{\"u}ge auswirken k{\"o}nnen, und somit entstehen Folgeversp{\"a}tungen. Jegliche Art der Versp{\"a}tung besitzt einen negativen Aspekt auf den Kundenkomfort, welcher eine Verschiebung des Modal Splits bewirkt.
Diese Arbeit f{\"u}r die Untersuchung der Fahrgastwechselzeit waren zahlreiche Datenerhebungen in Deutschland, der Schweiz und {\"O}sterreich notwendig, welche in den Sommermonaten 2007 durchgef{\"u}hrt wurden. Mittels Videoaufnahmen und deren Analysen konnten der exakte Zeitbedarf der Fahrg{\"a}ste f{\"u}rs Aus- und Einsteigen, das R{\"u}ckstauverhalten und das generelle Fahrgastverhalten ermittelt werden. Es wurden ungef{\"a}hr 3800 aussteigende und 7400 einsteigende Fahrg{\"a}ste gez{\"a}hlt.
Der Fahrgastwechsel kann prinzipiell in zwei Bereiche unterschieden werden. Zehn bis f{\"u}nfzehn Fahrg{\"a}ste beschreiben den Fahrgastwechsel an einer Einzelt{\"u}re und in einem Auffangbereich, da sich bei dieser Anzahl die R{\"u}ckstauwirkungen nicht aus dem Fahrzeuginneren bildet. In diesen beiden F{\"a}llen sind die Haupteinflussfaktoren vor allem die Agilit{\"a}t des Passagiers, dessen Gep{\"a}ck bez{\"u}glich Gr{\"o}{\ss}e und Gewicht, die zu Stufenanzahl und die T{\"u}rbreite. All diese Faktoren werden anhand von signifikanten Auswertungen quantifiziert.
F{\"u}r die Betrachtung der Fahrgastwechselzeit bezogen die Fahrzeuginnenraumgestaltung wird die Personenanzahl nicht weiter eingeschr{\"a}nkt. Auch im Fahrzeuginneren spielt die Gep{\"a}ckmitnahme eine gro{\ss}e Rolle bez{\"u}glich Gangbreiten und Ausweichm{\"o}glichkeiten. Die T{\"u}ranordnung und auch deren Anzahl ist ein weiterer Faktor, der in dieser Arbeit betrachtet wird.
Die Haltezeit kann auf ein Drittel reduziert werden durch Optimierung der Fahrzeuge und Harmonisierung dieser mit der Bahnsteigkante.

English:
The most important factor determining exchange times is passenger behaviour which is influenced by traveller characteristics, like age and / or mobility constrictions, the amount of luggage and finally the vehicle's design.
On days with high passenger-frequencies prolonged passenger exchange time results in extensive stop-over time. This leads to delays, which can also influence other trains and therefore cause further delays. Any delay reduces customer satisfaction, which, on the other hand, shifts modal split to the disadvantage of public transport. For the investigation of the passenger exchange time multiple data collections were necessary, which were done in summer 2007 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Video recording and analysis was used to determine exact passenger's time requirements, behaviour in tailbacks and general behaviour. Approximately 3800 descending and 7400 boarding passengers were evaluated. Passenger exchange can be divided into two parts. Ten to fifteen persons describe the passenger exchange at a single door and through an entrance area. This number allows to look at the tailback, which arises directly at the single door or the entrance area. The main parameters in both cases are the agility of the passenger, the luggage, the number of steps and the door width. These factors are described and quantified on the basis of significant analysis. For the passenger exchange relating to the coach's interior the number of travellers is not limited to fifteen. The amount of luggage plays a major role also in the vehicle's interior, concering to the aisle{\textquoteright}NAs width and the passing points. Arrangement and numbers of doors per coach are also fundamental factors
Stop-over time can be reduced to a third of the present one by optimisation of the vehicle and the harmonisation of the vehicle and the platform edge.},

  abstract = {Gibson's ecological theory of perception has received considerable attention within psychology literature, as well as in computer vision and robotics. However, few have applied Gibson's approach to agent-based models of human movement, because the ecological theory requires that individuals have a vision-based mental model of the world, and for large numbers of agents this becomes extremely expensive computationally. Thus, within current pedestrian models, path evaluation is based on calibration from observed data or on sophisticated but deterministic route-choice mechanisms; there is little open-ended behavioural modelling of human-movement patterns. One solution which allows individuals rapid concurrent access to the visual information within an environment is an 'exosomatic visual architecture', where the connections between mutually visible locations within a configuration are prestored in a lookup table. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of an exosomatic visual architecture, it is possible to develop behavioural models in which movement rules originating from Gibson's principle of affordance are utilised. We apply large numbers of agents programmed with these rules to a built-environment example and show that, by varying parameters such as destination selection, field of view, and steps taken between decision points, it is possible to generate aggregate movement levels very similar to those found in an actual building context.},

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

In so doing, we argue for an important distinction to be made between biological sex, gender role, and sexuality. To date, however, progress in the study of interpersonal distance (IPD) has been inhibited by poor operational definitions and inadequate measurement methodologies. For our own investigation, we innovated on methodology by devising the digital video-recording IPD method (DiVRID) that records interpersonal spatial relationships using high quality digital video equipment. The findings highlighted not only the validity of our innovative method of investigation, but also that a more sophisticated conceptualization of the impact of gender on IPD is warranted than can be accounted for by biological sex differences. In this study, we found that gender role accounts for more of the variation in IPD than the conventionally reported gender variable, sex.},

  abstract = {A bidimensional cellular automaton model is used to simulate the process of evacuation of pedestrians in a room with fixed obstacles. A floor field is defined so that moving to a cell with lower floor field means approaching an exit door. The model becomes non-deterministic by introducing a "panic" parameter, given by a probability of not moving, and by a random choice to resolve conflicts in the update of pedestrian positions. Two types of exit doors are considered: single (where only one person can pass) and double (two persons can pass simultaneously). For a double door, the longest evacuation time turns out to occur for a very traditional location of the door. The optimum door position is determined. Replacing the double door by two single doors does not improve evacuation times noticeably. On the other hand, for a room without obstacles, a simple scaling law is proposed to model the dependence of evacuation time with the number of persons and exit width. This model fails when obstacles are present, as their presence introduces local bottlenecks whose effect outweighs the benefits of increasing door width beyond a certain threshold.},

  abstract = {AbstractMost research on activist participation has aimed to explain motives to engage in protest and collective action or becoming an activist. The outcomes, for the individual, have been neglected. Therefore, we set out to systematically document and organize the psychological and behavioural changes associated with activism into a typology of change. The review contains 57 papers describing changes. Psychological changes identified in the literature can be classified into 19 main forms: marital status, children, relationship ties, work-life/career, extended involvement, consumer behaviour, identity, empowerment, radicalization/politicization, legitimacy, sustained commitment, self-esteem, general well-being, traits, self-confidence, religion, organizing, knowledge and home skills. Our analysis highlights the lack of analysis of the relation between type of protest and type of change, and lack of research into the processes behind the various psychological changes. What is needed now is more precise investigation of the relationship between types of protests, social and psychological processes, and psychological outcomes. Further, more longitudinal studies are required to explore the relationship.},

Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences.},

  abstract = {The simulation of large crowds of autonomous agents with realistic behavior is still a challenge for several computer research communities. In order to handle large crowds, some scalable architectures have been proposed. Nevertheless, the effective use of distributed systems requires the use of partitioning methods that can properly distribute the workload generated by agents among the existing distributed resources. In this paper, we analyze the use of irregular shape regions (convex hulls) for solving the partitioning problem. We have compared a partitioning method based on convex hulls with two techniques that use rectangular regions. The performance evaluation results show that the convex hull method outperforms the rest of the considered methods in terms of both fitness function values and execution times, regardless of the movement pattern followed by the agents. These results show that the shape of the regions in the partition can improve the performance of the partitioning method, rather than the heuristic method used.},

A number of different models from the family of Support Vector Machines, Radial Base Functions and Neural Networks are jointly considered and optimized with the aim to improve the short-term predictability of travel speed.

In this type of update, in each discrete timestep the particles are updated in a random sequence. Such an update is important for several applications, e.g., for certain models of pedestrian flow in two dimensions. For the ASEP with shuffled dynamics and a related truncated process exact results are obtained for deterministic motion ( p = 1). Since the shuffled dynamics is intrinsically stochastic, also this case is nontrivial. For the case of stochastic motion (0 < p < 1) it is shown that, in contrast to all other updates studied previously, the ASEP with shuffled update does not have a product measure steady state. Approximative formulae for the steady-state distribution and fundamental diagram are derived that are in very good agreement with simulation data.},

The micro-simulation software, VISSIM, is designed to model the pedestrian transfer in the Xizhimen Public Transportation Terminal (Beijing, China) in this paper. Four problems are found in the case study: severe disturbance between pedestrians and traffic flows, long transfer distances, bus waiting time and great traffic flow density. The paper proposes some measures for the solution to the problems, such as increasing the departure frequency of buses, building the crossing-street infrastructure for pedestrians, shortening transfer distances. The simulation result shows that the proposed methods in this paper are valuable in improving the efficiency of the transfer organizations of the Xizhimen Public Transportation Terminal (Beijing, China).},

  abstract  = {Visual analysis of human motion is currently one of the most active research topics in computer vision. This strong interest is driven by a wide spectrum of promising applications in many areas such as virtual reality, smart surveillance, perceptual interface, etc. Human motion analysis concerns the detection, tracking and recognition of people, and more generally, the understanding of human behaviors, from image sequences involving humans. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of research on computer-vision-based human motion analysis. The emphasis is on three major issues involved in a general human motion analysis system, namely human detection, tracking and activity understanding. Various methods for each issue are discussed in order to examine the state of the art. Finally, some research challenges and future directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Goal-directed pedestrian movement behavior is extensively studied by researchers from varied fields, but pedestrians movement actions such as impulse stops resulting from exploratory movement behavior receive little attention. To understand this, an effective tool that can reveal the attractive interactions between pedestrians and attractors in the environment is needed. This study introduces an agent-based microscopic pedestrian simulation model CityFlow-U. To determine whether a pedestrian would stop for visual attractors, factors of attractors attractiveness, distance to the attractor as well as the visibility of the attractor from current location of the agent are considered. By analyzing the parameters in this model, we have successfully revealed different pedestrian movement modes, attractor preferences and movement trajectories in a notional setting. The reliability of the model is then demonstrated with a simulation scenario targeting at a circulation region of a shopping mall in Hong Kong. Observational data is used for model input and the number changes of attracted pedestrians in front of a major attractor are compared between simulation results and empirical video data. Results from the parameter analysis and simulation scenario show that the model is flexible and can benefit in real applications such as shop arrangement as well as street furniture placement.},

Here we show that both speed and accuracy of decision making increase with group size in fish shoals under predation threat. We examined two plausible mechanisms for this improvement: first, that groups are guided by a small proportion of high-quality decision makers and, second, that group members use self-organized division of vigilance. Repeated testing of individuals showed no evidence of different decision-making abilities between individual fish. Instead, we suggest that shoals achieve greater decision-making efficiencies through division of labor combined with social information transfer. Our results should prompt reconsideration of how we view cooperation in animal groups with fluid membership.},

However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

  abstract = {The layout of seating within train carriages, of which there are numerous possibilities, and also the occupancy of that seating can be expected to impact on passengers{\textquoteright} experiences of a train journey. However, there is very little evidence on how rail passengers value different seating experiences. On the back of exploratory research, and including attitudinal evidence, this paper provides significant and original insights into rail passenger{\textquoteright}s preferences in this area. The primary evidence base is a Stated Preference experiment, complemented by a novel Revealed Preference exercise that uses CCTV footage to observe where rail passengers prefer to sit.

The valuations, expressed as travel time multipliers, obtained from the Stated Preference exercise are generally plausible and exhibit a wide range according to the precise seating configuration, the occupancy level and the seating position within a layout. The innovative Revealed Preference analysis provides an encouraging degree of support to the Stated Preference results which, reassuringly, can themselves be reconciled with related valuations widely used in the railway industry in Britain and also the findings of the exploratory and attitudinal research. Whilst we are interested here solely in obtaining valuations, we demonstrate how they can be used in demand forecasting.},

Second, the experiment is conducted with the simulation platform to study the relationships of average system velocity, flow, system scale, pedestrian density and stair series for obtaining the bi-directional pedestrian flow characteristic. The results of numerical analysis had shown that when the pedestrian density reached the critical value, the pedestrian flow was changed from free flow status to blocking flow status, and the distribution ratio of bi-directional pedestrians and channel width had great effect on the average system velocity and the flow. Moreover, the more the stair series was, the more obvious the faster-is-slower effect was.},

  abstract = {The linked cell algorithm is an essential part of molecular simulation software, both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. Though it scales linearly with the number of particles, there has been a constant interest in increasing its performance, because a large part of \{CPU\} time is spent to identify the interacting particles. Several recent publications proposed improvements to the algorithm and investigated their efficiency by applying them to particular setups. Here we develop a general method to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms which is mostly independent of the parameters of the simulation, and test it for a number of linked cell algorithms. We also propose a combination of linked cell reordering and interaction sorting that performs well for a broad range of simulation setups.},

  Abstract                 = {When human observers are exposed to even slight motion signals followed by brief visual transients-stimuli containing no detectable coherent motion signals-they perceive large and salient illusory jumps. This visually striking effect, which we call "high phi," challenges well-entrenched assumptions about the perception of motion, namely the minimal-motion principle and the breakdown of coherent motion perception with steps above an upper limit called dmax. Our experiments with transients, such as texture randomization or contrast reversal, show that the magnitude of the jump depends on spatial frequency and transient duration-but not on the speed of the inducing motion signals-and the direction of the jump depends on the duration of the inducer. Jump magnitude is robust across jump directions and different types of transient. In addition, when a texture is actually displaced by a large step beyond the upper step size limit of dmax, a breakdown of coherent motion perception is expected; however, in the presence of an inducer, observers again perceive coherent displacements at or just above dmax. In summary, across a large variety of stimuli, we find that when incoherent motion noise is preceded by a small bias, instead of perceiving little or no motion-as suggested by the minimal-motion principle-observers perceive jumps whose amplitude closely follows their own dmax limits.},

The intermediate multipole and Taylor expansions are defined differently from previous work to yield simplified and more efficient transformations. Error estimates are obtained due to the effect of multipole truncation and the use of the multipole to Taylor transformation operator. Efficient implementation of the FMM for potential and forces is discussed, and calculations are presented that probe the accuracy and performance of the method.},

Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus are thought to participate in the formation of a dynamic representation of the animal's current location, and these cells are presumably critical for storing the representation in memory. To traverse the environment, animals must be able to translate coordinate information from spatial maps in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus into body-centered representations that can be used to direct locomotion. How this is done remains an enigma. We propose that the posterior parietal cortex is critical for this transformation.},

  Abstract                 = {Accelerated gradient methods play a central role in optimization, achieving optimal rates in many settings. While many generalizations and extensions of Nesterov's original acceleration method have been proposed, it is not yet clear what is the natural scope of the acceleration concept. In this paper, we study accelerated methods from a continuous-time perspective. We show that there is a Lagrangian functional that we call the \emph{Bregman Lagrangian} which generates a large class of accelerated methods in continuous time, including (but not limited to) accelerated gradient descent, its non-Euclidean extension, and accelerated higher-order gradient methods. We show that the continuous-time limit of all of these methods correspond to traveling the same curve in spacetime at different speeds. From this perspective, Nesterov's technique and many of its generalizations can be viewed as a systematic way to go from the continuous-time curves generated by the Bregman Lagrangian to a family of discrete-time accelerated algorithms.},

Research on wayfinding has been conducted with different paradigms using a variety of wayfinding tasks. This makes it difficult to compare the results and implications of many studies. A systematic classification is needed in order to determine and investigate the cognitive processes and structural components of how humans solve wayfinding problems. Current classifications of wayfinding distinguish tasks on a rather coarse level or do not take the navigators knowledge, a key factor in wayfinding, into account.We present an extended taxonomy of wayfinding that distinguishes tasks by external constraints as well as by the level of spatial knowledge that is available to the navigator. The taxonomy will help to decrease ambiguity of wayfinding tasks and it will facilitate understanding of the differentiated demands a navigator faces when solving wayfinding problems.},

  Abstract                 = {A data driven, kernel-based method for approximating the leading Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes in problems with high dimensional state spaces is presented. This approach approximates the Koopman operator using a set of scalar observables, which are functions defined on state space, that is determined {\em implicitly} by the choice of a kernel. This circumvents the computational issues that arise due to the number of basis functions required to span a "sufficiently rich" subspace of the space of scalar observables in these problems. We illustrate this method on the FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, a prototypical example of a one-dimensional reaction diffusion system, and compare our results with related methods such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that have the same computational cost as our approach. In this example, the resulting approximations of the leading Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes are both more accurate and less sensitive to the distribution of the data used in the computation than those produced by DMD.},

The model is equivalent to the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with periodic boundary conditions and shuffled dynamics. In this type of update, the positions of the pedestrians are updated in a random order during one discrete time step. We derive expressions for the fundamental diagrams that are in very good agreement with simulation data. Finally we make a generalization to higher velocities and to two dimensions without lane-changing of the pedestrians.},

It was predicted that violation of personal space rather than simple density is the spatial variable associated with crowding and that the experience of crowding can be alleviated if the individual is distracted from making the attribution that his or her arousal is caused by other people. To test these predictions, interaction distance (close and far) and density (high and low) were varied separately in a study with 315 male undergraduates. For half of the conditions, pictures (attribution inhibitors) were placed on the walls of the experimental room, and in the other half, the walls were bare. Ss worked on 2 tasks and were then questioned about their experience of crowding. Interaction distance was more closely related to crowding than density, and pictures reduced the experiences of crowding only in the close interaction conditions. Results support the attribution analysis of crowding. (27 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among 1 million users of an interactive web site, digg.com, devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.},

The authors hypothesized that action planning may prime perceptual dimensions that provide information for the open parameters of that action. Indeed, preparing for grasping facilitated detection of size targets while preparing for pointing facilitated detection of luminance targets. Following the Theory of Event Coding (Hommel, M\"usseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001b), the authors suggest that perceptual dimensions may be intentionally weighted with respect to an intended action. More interesting, the action-related influences were observed only when participants searched for a predefined target. This implies that action-related weighting is not independent from task-relevance weighting. To account for our findings, the authors suggest an integrative model of visual search that incorporates input from action-planning processes.},

  abstract = {Local density, which is an indicator for comfortable moving of a pedestrian, is rarely considered in traditional force based and heuristics based pedestrian flow models. However, comfortable moving is surely a demand of pedestrian in normal situations. Recently, Voronoi diagram had been successfully adopted to obtain the local density of a pedestrian in empirical studies. In this paper, Voronoi diagram is introduced into the heuristics based pedestrian flow model. It provides not only local density but also other information for determining moving velocity and direction. Those information include personal space, safe distance, neighbors, and three elementary characteristics directions. Several typical scenarios are set up to verify the proposed model. The simulation results show that the velocity-density relations and capacities of bottleneck are consistent with the empirical data, and many self-organization phenomena, i.e., arching phenomenon and lane formation, are also reproduced. The pedestrians are likely to be homogeneously distributed when they are sensitive to local density, otherwise pedestrians are non-uniformly distributed and the stop-and-go waves are likely to be reproduced. Such results indicate that the Voronoi diagram is a promising tool in modeling pedestrian dynamics.},

Based on representation of perceptual information, we study the effect of speed and density on pedestrian walking behavior. Then, simple behavior heuristics of pedestrian motion was proposed to study the pedestrian adapted walking behavior to the destination. Subsequently, the microscopic simulation was executed, by which the emergence of complex crowd behavior is reproduced, such as lane formation and fundamental diagram was compared with the existing studies. The results show that the curve of the average crowd speed against the density is qualitatively consistent with the reported results at least in the low and intermediate density range.},

The scheme is based on the real-coded lattice gas (RLG), which has been developed for fluid simulation. Similar to RLG, the position and velocity can be freely given, independent of grid points. Our strategy including the procedure for updating the position of each pedestrian is explained. It is shown that the movement of pedestrians in an oblique direction to the grid is successfully simulated by RCA, which was not taken into account in the previous CA models. Moreover, from simulations of evacuation from a room with an exit of various widths, we obtain the critical number of people beyond which the clogging appears at the exit.},

The phenomenon of the kin behavior often occurs during evacuation. In this paper, a two-dimensional Cellular Automata model is applied to simulate the process of evacuation with respect to the kin behavior. Many interesting phenomena during real evacuation, such as incoherence, jamming, gathering, backtracking and waiting, are simulated by the variation of the building structure, the occupants' arrangement, the kin attraction and the route selection. We conclude that the psychology of going with the crowd is not always harmful; the conclusions about the kin behavior in one-exit case are the same as those in two-exits case; the number of the sub-groups and the members in each sub-group influence the evacuation efficiency a lot; the typical phenomena of waiting and backtracking in real evacuation do reduce the evacuation efficiency. We have preliminarily found that the proper kin behavior is beneficial to improve the evacuation efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the subway platform, not all passengers distribute randomly but gather in the waiting areas, especially when a train is coming. During emergency evacuations, passengers' initial distribution may play a significant role in affecting the escape efficiency. In this paper, a passenger distribution modelling method is proposed to predict such waiting area choice processes based on ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, which is really a complicated job due to many influence factors. The model considers the distance to the target waiting area, the length of queues, the physical length of waiting areas and the train schedule as four main influence factors. Specially, a modification of the passenger's impatience factor in the famous social force model (SFM), better reflecting the change of psychological states with an arrival of a train, is presented. The field data collected at the Xuanwumen subway platform is utilized for the model calibration and validation. The ultimate simulation results demonstrate that passenger distributions based on ACO algorithm basically can reflect the field distribution and also the dynamic characteristics of waiting area choice processes. Impacts of passenger distributions on evacuation dynamics under fires are further studied based on the software FDS+Evac. The results indicate that passenger distribution does has little impact on evacuation efficiency when fires are not very large, while the evacuation will be affected significantly by passenger distributions once fires are large enough. This further indicates the necessity of studying the passenger distribution at the subway platform especially under emergencies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Computer Vision (CV) based surveillance in crowded scenes is one of the most significant and promising topics due to the increase of people gatherings in public places where the possibilities of disasters and stampedes is also high. Therefore, it is essential to develop a well established Crowd Disaster Avoidance System (CDAS) for the public safety. In general, CV-CDAS focuses on crowd scene analysis, crowd behavior analysis and crowd management. Either, a stampede may occur due to abnormal behavior of individuals in a crowd or a crowd may behave abnormally after the stampede. Even though behavior analysis of a crowd plays an essential role, it is inadequate to decide whether a stampede may occur or not at that instance. Despite significant progress and various surveys on crowd scene, crowd modeling and behavior analysis over the past few decades, the existing surveys still fail to discuss and delineate the crowd disaster analysis based on many key aspects as a whole. However, CV-CDAS needs to be developed based on the necessary factors such as the number of cameras (single/multiple), target of interest (an individual/group or crowd), crowd scene (structured/unstructured), crowd motion (static/dynamic), crowd behavior analysis, people count and crowd density estimation, person re-identification in crowd, crowd evacuation, forensic analysis on crowd disaster and computations on crowd analysis. Consequently, taking all these factors into an account, this survey aims to deliberate a road map to develop a stable CV-CDAS which includes recent trends and approaches in the crowd disaster analysis. In addition, behavior analysis plays a vital role and hence, an extended version of existing survey with the perspective of single and multiple cameras is elaborated. Besides, it summarizes the crowd disaster problem handled by various \{CV\} algorithms in the past and also paves a way to avoid this problem in future. Moreover, this survey presents the existing benchmark datasets with their specifications and performance evaluation metrics with special focus on dataset which will be suitable for specific application and it helps the researchers to select appropriate dataset for evaluation. Finally, this paper concludes with open issues and directions for future research which may further motivate and guide the academic and industrial personnel, involved in developing CV-based crowd disaster management systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a model of overtaking behavior that can be used to simulate unidirectional pedestrian flow in routine. All pedestrians have the ability to determine whether or not to overtake other pedestrians according to their desired velocity and position. Although existing models such as cellular automata models, lattice gas models, social force models, etc., can be used to predict evacuation performance, most of these models are either computationally inefficient or do not account for some crucial elements of human behavior in a moving crowd. Furthermore, these models use either empirical equations developed from experiments or mechanical system analogies to determine movement decisions. The pedestrian flow patterns simulated by these models may deviate significantly from reality. In reality, pedestrians walk at different velocities and pedestrians with a higher walking velocity are accustomed to overtaking other pedestrians with a lower walking velocity and this paper aims to mimic this behavior as the original social force model developed by Helbing et al. does not reflect this pattern of collective pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose modifications of the social force model that reflects how overtaking behavior operates in routine. The comparison of the pedestrian flow pattern between the original social force model and the modified social force models with the real data collected by the camcorder is also performed in order to demonstrate our modified social force model can be used to achieve reasonable simulations of overtaking behavior among pedestrians.},

Inspired by Dirk Hartmann, the Optimal Steps Model, which was developed at the University of Applied Sciences Munich, is extended to navigation around pedestrain groups and queueing. In his contribution, Dirk Hartmann considers a new method for dynamic medium scale navigation in microscopic pedestrian simulation. The central idea is to replace the constant speed function F = 1 in the Eikonal equation by a speed function that depends on the local density. A new contribution is to calculate potential differentials to consider the influence of walking direction and walking speed on navigation behavior. Another important part of this work is a first contribution to forced-based modelling of queueing. The idea is to increase the speed F for areas with a high local pedestrian density. An adequate definition of density is required and has to be discussed. It will be shown that the measurement of the density can be done efficiently using image processing techniques.},

We first explain how artificial microswimmers move forward by generating near-surface flow fields via self-phoresis or the self-induced Marangoni effect. We then discuss generic features of the dynamics of single active colloids in bulk and in confinement, as well as in the presence of gravity, field gradients, and fluid flow. In the third section, we review the emergent collective behavior of active colloidal suspensions, focusing on their structural and dynamic properties. After summarizing experimental observations, we give an overview of the progress in modeling collectively moving active colloids. While active Brownian particles are heavily used to study collective dynamics on large scales, more advanced methods are necessary to explore the importance of hydrodynamic and phoretic particle interactions. Finally, the relevant physical approaches to quantify the emergent collective behavior are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Planning pedestrian environments requires assumptions about how pedestrians will respond to characteristics of the environment as they formulate and enact their walking itineraries. As a consequence, most research interest in public environments focuses on behavior in relation to those characteristics. For example, there is a substantial body of descriptive and typological studies of pedestrian environments. Metric, geometric, and topological models have proved useful in characterizing density and direction of movement. The need to understand the mechanism of choice has prompted microscale and laboratory-based research on exploratory spatial behavior within walking districts. Studies of behavior in relation to comfort, the way in which images of places impinge on choices, and how dynamic and serial experience of the city affects individual itineraries have all developed as specialized fields of understanding. In general, studies of pedestrian environment dynamics have both diversified and multiplied as its systems and methodologies are adapted for planning other environments.},

  abstract  = {In [C.W. Gear, T.J. Kaper, I.G. Kevrekidis and A. Zagaris, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 4 (2005) 711-732], we developed a class of iterative algorithms within the context of equation-free methods to approximate low-dimensional, attracting, slow manifolds in systems of differential equations with multiple time scales. For user-specified values of a finite number of the observables, the mth member of the class of algorithms ($m = 0, 1, \ldots$) finds iteratively an approximation of the appropriate zero of the (m+1)st time derivative of the remaining variables and uses this root to approximate the location of the point on the slow manifold corresponding to these values of the observables. This article is the first of two articles in which the accuracy and convergence of the iterative algorithms are analyzed. Here, we work directly with fast-slow systems, in which there is an explicit small parameter, epsilon, measuring the separation of time scales. We show that, for each $m = 0, 1, \ldots$, the fixed point of the iterative algorithm approximates the slow manifold up to and including terms of $\{\mathcal O\}(\varepsilon^m)$. Moreover, for each m, we identify explicitly the conditions under which the mth iterative algorithm converges to this fixed point. Finally, we show that when the iteration is unstable (or converges slowly) it may be stabilized (or its convergence may be accelerated) by application of the Recursive Projection Method. Alternatively, the Newton-Krylov Generalized Minimal Residual Method may be used. In the subsequent article, we will consider the accuracy and convergence of the iterative algorithms for a broader class of systems - in which there need not be an explicit small parameter - to which the algorithms also apply.},

  abstract = {We develop a collision-avoiding mechanism for a system of individual agents (pedestrians) that move in a crowd trying to reach their different goal points. The agents avoid collisions on the basis of a model of the other agents' behavior, a "theory of mind," which is realized at different levels through an iterative process (the first level, or level 0, corresponds to ignoring the other agents' behavior, level 1 to assuming that the other agents will ignore each other, and so on).

The model is conceived in order to perform an evolutionary simulation of some basic parameters that determine the agent's sensorial, cognitive and behavioral system (the perception of the agent's own size, the attraction to the goal, the radius and angle of the field of view and the level of the theory of mind).

In this preliminary work we present our model, show that it reproduces some of the simplest organized behaviors of a system of pedestrians, and focus on some features of the theory of mind, as the difference between odd and even levels.},

By comparing with real world data, we show that the introduction of this norm allows for a better reproduction of macroscopic pedestrian density and velocity patterns.},

fast as possible. However, there has been much less awareness for this issue on preference
for stairs and human behaviors under different illuminations. Experiments were carried
out to study the human movement characteristics and human behavior performance
when pedestrians walked down stairs alone. By extracting the positions of pedestrians
on cameras, preference and movement characteristics were studied and discussed, and it
is found that pedestrians would like to choose inner side stairs rather than outside stairs
when stairs were divided into 2 parts. Besides, some conclusions can be drawn when stairs
are divided into three components: when entering into sections under conditions of 100%
and 12% illumination, both females and males have a preference for middle areas when
the width of stairs is about 130 cm, but the preference would change with illumination
conditions. Furthermore, when the illumination is 0%, the mean velocity is 0.50 +/- 0.14
m/s. In addition, the usability to handrails helps to reduce time taken on interfaces or midlandings.
The results help to better understand movement during stair evacuations and are
important for constructing or improving evacuation models.},

For various forms of ordering in bidirectional streams, no large differences among density-flow relationships are found in the observed density range. The fundamental diagrams of bidirectional streams with different forms of ordering are compared with those of unidirectional streams. The result shows differences in the shape of the relation for rho > 1.0m^-2 .

But the empirical databases for quantitative calibration are still insufficient, e.g. the fundamental diagram as one of the most important relationships displays non-negligible differences among various studies. To improve this situation, experiments in straight corridors and T-junctions are performed. Four different measurement methods are defined to study their effects on the fundamental diagram. It is shown that they have minor influences for rho < 3.5^m-2 but only the Voronoi method is able to resolve the fine structure of the fundamental diagram. This enhanced measurement method permits us to observe the occurrence of a boundary-induced phase transition. For corridors of different widths we found that the specific flow concept works well for rho < 3.5^m-2 . Moreover, we illustrate the discrepancies between the fundamental diagrams of a T-junction and a straight corridor.},

The formulation is based on a reconstruction of the density distribution and the underlying physics, including the rule for resolving conflicts, which is comparable to that in the floor field cellular automaton model. However, we assume that each pedestrian is familiar with the surroundings, thereby minimizing his or her instantaneous cost. This, in turn, helps reduce the randomness in selecting a target cell, which improves the existing cellular automata modelings, together with the computational efficiency. In the presence of two pedestrian groups, which are distinguished by their destinations, the cost distribution for each group is magnified due to the strong interaction between the two groups. As a typical phenomenon, the formation of lanes in the counter flow is reproduced.},

Three categories of potential fields were defined to model the pedestrian behavior by simulating pedestrians' decision processes. A circumstance potential field was defined to simulate the desire to targets. Moving and waiting potential fields were defined to model the interaction. Experiments were run for the model validation and coefficient performance verification. Performances and relationships of sensitivity coefficient, decay coefficient and diffusion coefficient are studied to clarify the effectiveness and flexibility of the presented model in generating pedestrian movement under a variety of situations.

  Abstract                 = {Analog forecasting is a nonparametric technique introduced by Lorenz in 1969 which predicts the evolution of states of a dynamical system (or observables defined on the states) by following the evolution of the sample in a historical record of observations which most closely resembles the current initial data. Here, we introduce a suite of forecasting methods which improve traditional analog forecasting by combining ideas from kernel methods developed in harmonic analysis and machine learning and state-space reconstruction for dynamical systems. A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog forecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local similarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent features designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate maps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial observations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field generating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel methods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative strategies based on the Nystr\"om method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids technique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a low-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic metastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of a comprehensive climate model. We find that forecasts based on kernel-weighted ensembles have significantly higher skill than the conventional approach following a single analog.},

  abstract  = {Evacuation simulation and especially the determination of evacuation times is a very complex task. Moreover the prognosis of place and time of critical bottlenecks within the building during the evacuation is critical due to complex building structures and the correct pedestrian behavior. Therefore, an extensive validation and calibration of the simulation algorithms is an indispensable requirement for every simulation tool. An automatic test suite for different scenarios will facilitate this task yielding in proven, automated and reproducible results. The microscopic pedestrian simulator tested in this paper is developed by our group. The tool can be used to guide the crowd evacuation and prepare respond plans for emergent situations as reference to city council and law enforcement agency. It is important that the simulation results reveal the true behavior of pedestrian; for certain precaution actions can be taken in order to guarantee the safety of the crowd.

In this paper, we documented the performance of our simulator tested with all 14 scenarios proposed by the RiMEA (Richtlinie fur Mikroskopische Entfluchtungs-Analysen) guideline. The test results show that our simulator passes all the tests. Moreover, our pedestrian simulator constantly improves its performance by cooperating with construction companies and government departments running on-site tests with first-hand data. Now it covers even emergency scenarios such as fire/smoke and floods.},

In the method, the torque compensation adaptive excitation control strategy is used for sagittal control and PID is applied to the upper body for the robots lateral stability. It is verified by the co-simulation based on ADAMS and MATLAB that the bipedal robot can reach the stable humanoid gait with the high energy efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {When one is immersed in the fascinating world of neuroscience findings, the brain might start to seem like a collection of "modules," each specializes in a specific mental feat. But just like in other domains of Nature, it is possible that much of the brain and mind's operation can be explained with a small set of universal principles. Given exciting recent developments in theory, empirical findings and computational studies, it seems that the generation of predictions might be one strong candidate for such a universal principle. This is the focus of Predictions in the Brain. From the predictions required when a rat navigates a maze to food-caching in scrub-jays; from predictions essential in decision-making to social interactions; from predictions in the retina to the prefrontal cortex; and from predictions in early development to foresight in non-humans. The perspectives represented in this collection span a spectrum from the cellular underpinnings to the computational principles underlying future-related mental processes, and from systems neuroscience to cognition and emotion. In spite of this diversity, they share some core elements. Memory, for instance, is critical in any framework that explains predictions. In asking "what is next?" our brains have to refer to memory and experience on the way to simulating our mental future. But as much as this collection offers answers to important questions, it raises and emphasizes outstanding ones. How are experiences coded optimally to afford using them for predictions? How do we construct a new simulation from separate memories? How specific in detail are future-oriented thoughts, and when do they rely on imagery, concepts or language? Therefore, in addition to presenting the state-of-the-art of research and ideas about predictions as a universal principle in mind and brain, it is hoped that this collection will stimulate important new research into the foundations of our mental lives.},

  abstract        = {It is important to study pedestrian stepping behavior and characteristics for facility design and pedestrian flow study due to pedestrians' 
bipedal movement. In this paper, data of steps are extracted based on trajectories of pedestrians from a single-file experiment. It is found that step length and step frequency will decrease 75% and 33%, respectively, when global density increases from 0.46 ped/m to 2.28 ped/m. With the increment of headway, they will first increase and then remain constant when the headway is beyond 1.16 m and 0.91 m, respectively. 
Step length and frequency under different headways can be described well by normal distributions. Meanwhile, relationships between step length and frequency under different headways exist. Step frequency decreases with the increment of step length. However, the decrease tendencies depend on headways as a whole. And there are two decrease tendencies: when the headway is between about 0.6 m and 1.0 m, the decrease rate of the step frequency will increase with the increment of step length; while it will decrease when the headway is beyond about 1.0 m and below about 0.6 m. A model is built based on the experiment results. In fundamental diagrams, the results of simulation agree well with those of experiment. The study can be helpful for understanding pedestrian stepping behavior and designing public facilities.},

  abstract = {During a fire evacuation, once an individual perceives cues from a fire event, they must interpret them to assess the new situation and determine whether action is required. It is proposed that this assessment and action selection can employ either an automatic or reflective processing system depending on the nature of the situation and the experiences of the individual involved. This decision-making process is bounded in terms of the information available, the time available, and an individual's resources to process such information that influences which processing mechanism is adopted. To compensate for such limitations and manage the uncertainty and complexity associated with the decision-making process, people may employ heuristics that reduce decision-making from a cognitively effortful problem-solving task requiring mental reflection, to a less effortful pattern-matching process, where stored conditions and expectations are quickly scanned to identify relevant responses. During this decision-making process cognitive biases may occur which cause an individual to neglect or be biased towards certain information: this may potentially lead to an inappropriate and/or unexpected response. Cognitive biases affect performance without the individual being directly aware of them. This paper identifies cognitive biases from existing literature that may influence a person's decision-making process during a fire evacuation, along with how these align with general decision-making in the process. The purpose of the article is to promote consideration of cognitive biases in the modeling of evacuee behavior, as well as during the fire safety design of buildings and evacuation procedures.},

  abstract     = {This work combines a review and a research need statement part. In
the review part some indications are collected that for the variation of
walking speeds stride length is varied more than stride frequency. It is
argued that this limits the variation of walking speeds on stairs where the
stride length is fixed as long as one stair is taken at a time. Furthermore
data from various sources is presented that indicates that for upstairs
movement there is a limit for vertical speed stemming from general hu-
man performance limits. This limit adds to the restriction of (up-)stairs
walking speeds.
The research need statement part of the paper demonstrates that a
simulation of pedestrian dynamics predicts a smaller 
ow (and consequently larger evacuation times) if pedestrians have a different percentile
regarding the speed distributions for 
at and stairs movement. This is
an interesting phenomenon since a bottleneck is created which depends
on the dynamic interplay between the walking geometry and properties
of the population. It is therefore desirable to investigate the phenomenon
not only with simulations but also empirically.},

movement. The investigation of stepping locomotion and its affecting
factors is necessary for a more realistic knowledge of human movement,
which is usually referred to as walking with equal step lengths for the
right and left leg. To study pedestrians'stepping locomotion, a set
of single-file movement experiments involving 39 participants of the
same age walking on a highly curved oval course is conducted. The
microscopic characteristics of the pedestrians including 1D Voronoi
density, speed, and step length are calculated based on a projected
coordinate. The influence of the projection lines with different radii
on the measurement of these quantities is investigated. The step lengths
from the straight and curved parts are compared using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. During the experiments, six different step
styles are observed and the proportions of different step styles change
with the density. At low density, the main step style is the
stable-large step style and the step lengths of one pedestrian are
almost constant. At high density, some pedestrians adjust and decrease
their step lengths. Some pedestrians take relatively smaller and larger
steps alternately to adapt to limited space.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present simple and efficient array-based mesh data structures, including a compact representation of the half-edge data structure for surface meshes, and its generalization---a half-face data structure---for volume meshes. These array-based structures provide comprehensive and efficient support for querying incidence, adjacency, and boundary classification, but require substantially less memory than pointer-based mesh representations. In addition, they are easy to implement in traditional programming languages (such as in C or Fortran 90) and convenient to exchange across different software packages or different storage media. In a parallel setting, they also support partitioned meshes and hence are particularly appealing for large-scale scientific and engineering applications. We demonstrate the construction and usage of these data structures for various operations, and compare their space and time complexities with alternative structures.},

agents. This formulation allows an agent to exercise influence over other agents greater than that implied by its
physical properties. Composite agents can be added to most agent-based simulation systems and used to model
emergent behaviors among individuals. In practice, there is negligible overhead of introducing composite agents
in the simulation. We highlight their application to modeling aggression, social priority, authority, protection and
guidance in complex scenes.},

  doi      = {10.1002/ejsp.2376},
  abstract = {The question of how normative form changes during a riot, and thus how collective behaviour spreads to different targets and locations, has been neglected in previous research, despite its theoretical and practical importance. We begin to address this limitation through a detailed analysis of the rioting in the London borough of Haringey in 2011. 
A triangulated analysis of multiple sources of data (including police reports, media accounts, and videos) finds a pattern of behaviour shifting from collective attacks on police targets to looting. 
A thematic analysis of 41 interview accounts with participants gathered shortly after the events suggests that a shared anti-police identity allowed local postcode rivalries to be overcome, forming the basis of empowered action not only against the police but to address more long-standing grievances and desires. 
It is argued that collective psychological empowerment operated in a positive feedback loop, whereby one form of collective self-objectification (and perceived inability of police to respond) formed the basis of further action. This analysis of the development of new targets in an empowered crowd both confirms and extends the elaborated social identity model as an explanation for conflictual intergroup dynamics.},

time consuming task. By drawing the successful experiences of behavior-based
AI and multi-agent simulation framework, this paper presents a behavior-based
crowd simulation framework for riot controlling in city environment. A well designed
behavior-based prototype system is developed, which takes the advantages
of the dynamics of interaction among the basis behaviors repertoires. The
basis behaviors repertoires implemented by decision rules are composed of
three parts, which correspond to the behaviors of the civilians, riots and soldiers
respectively. Then these basis behaviors are combined into more complex behaviors
by behavior selection mechanism. Eventually realistic crowd phenomena
are created in the scenarios of riot controlling in city environment. We argue
that this approach gives better results than conventional methods.},

  url      = {https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-03943-5#toc},
  abstract = {The last few years have seen a great increase in the amount of data available to scientists. Datasets with millions of objects and hundreds, if not thousands of measurements are now commonplace in many disciplines. However, many of the computational techniques used to analyse this data cannot cope with such large datasets. Therefore, strategies need to be employed as a pre-processing step to reduce the number of objects, or measurements, whilst retaining important information inherent to the data. Spectral dimensionality reduction is one such family of methods that has proven to be an indispensable tool in the data processing pipeline. In recent years the area has gained much attention thanks to the development of nonlinear spectral dimensionality reduction methods, often referred to as manifold learning algorithms.

Numerous algorithms and improvements have been proposed for the purpose of performing spectral dimensionality reduction, yet there is still no gold standard technique.

Those wishing to use spectral dimensionality reduction without prior knowledge of the field will immediately be confronted with questions that need answering: What parameter values to use? How many dimensions should the data be embedded into? How are new data points incorporated? What about large-scale data? For many, a search of the literature to find answers to these questions is impractical, as such, there is a need for a concise discussion into the problems themselves, how they affect spectral dimensionality reduction, and how these problems can be overcome.
This book provides a survey and reference aimed at advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as researchers, scientists, and engineers in a wide range of disciplines. Dimensionality reduction has proven useful in a wide range of problem domains and so this book will be applicable to anyone with a solid grounding in statistics and computer science seeking to apply spectral dimensionality to their work.},

  abstract        = {With more and more high-rise building springing into the cities, the movement of pedestrians on stairs is of great importance for the evacuation of these facilities; the topic of human performance on stairs has attracted a lot of researcher to study. However, there is still a lack of analysis of specific situations, such as mid-landing and merging behaviors. In this paper we employ a modified version of the Optimal Steps Model, modified by taking block-based floor field into consideration under open boundary conditions, to reproduce movement at mid-landing and study performance of occupants in stairwell. Movements on this kind of stairs are simulated and studied with the help of extended model: achieved results are in accord with previous research in respect of specific flow and fundamental diagram. Lane formations on stairs come into being before mid-landing area through simulations. Furthermore most people reach at the mid-landing by the outside stairs at higher density due to more space and less force from other agents, which is induced that outside of the stairs is good for evacuation. At last the model is implemented to study the effect of stairs geometry on merging behaviors, and it is found when corridor is connected to the landing opposite to the incoming stairs, this structure is biased in favor of occupants from stairs. The work in this paper is intended to better understand movement during stair evacuations and develop a technical foundation for codes and standards requirements as well as egress modeling techniques.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze individual unimpeded stair ascent and descent walk speeds for the Korean population. To collect these data, a full-scale experiment was conducted in a 50-storey residential building in Korea involving 30 male and 30 female participants with an average age of 23.4 years. Each participant was required to ascend 50 floors and after a suitable rest period was then required to descend 50 floors using the stairs. Arrival times on each floor were recorded using video cameras, allowing floor by floor walk speeds to be determined and to assess whether fatigue affected the descent/ascent. The average descent speed for the male and female population was 0.83 m/s and 0.74 m/s, respectively, while the average ascent speed was 0.66 m/s and 0.48 m/s. However, there was no significant relationship between body mass index and stair walk speed or unimpeded horizontal walk speed and stair walk speed. During the descent, 50% of the population displayed a decrease in the walk speed over the final half of the descent with a maximum decrease of some 19%. However, some 50% of the population increased their travel speed during the final half of the descent. During the ascent, all participants decreased their speed over the first 20 floors by an average of approximately 60%. Implications of these findings for evacuation modeling/simulation are discussed.},

This introductory article presents the focal theme of the project --- the impact of contextual variation on mobilization dynamics, the composition of the crowd and the demonstrators' motives. The various contextual layers we are distinguishing are discussed. Following the theoretical framework the methodological set-up is presented. Identical measures and procedures are employed in all individual protest surveys. This introduction discusses the sampling procedures; but as each article concerns a different set of measures, the selection employed is discussed in the individual articles. The introduction concludes with an overview of the articles included.},

In this study, we aim to create a system that enables the specification of different crowd types ranging from audiences to mobs. In order to achieve this goal we parametrize the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. Because mobs are characterized by emotionality, we describe a framework that associates psychological components with individual agents comprising a crowd and yields emergent behaviors in the crowd as a whole. To explore the effectiveness of our framework we demonstrate two scenarios simulating the behavior of distinct mob types.},

Much subsequent discourse has questioned the adequacy of the police response, in terms of the resources available and strategies used. In this article, we present a mathematical model of the spatial development of the disorder, which can be used to examine the effect of varying policing arrangements. The model is capable of simulating the general emergent patterns of the events and focusses on three fundamental aspects: the apparently-contagious nature of participation; the distances travelled to riot locations; and the deterrent effect of policing. We demonstrate that the spatial configuration of London places some areas at naturally higher risk than others, highlighting the importance of spatial considerations when planning for such events. We also investigate the consequences of varying police numbers and reaction time, which has the potential to guide policy in this area.},

It is able to deal with non sharp segment boundaries. A flexible, interactive modulation of the front speed depending on various boundary and regularization criteria ensure this goal. Efficiency is due to a graded underlying mesh implicitly defined via error or feature indicators. A suitable saturation condition ensures an important regularity condition on the resulting adaptive grid. As a casy study the segmentation of glioma is considered. The clinician interactively selects a few parameters describing the speed function and a few seed points. The automatic process of front propagation then generates a family of segments corresponding to the evolution of the front in time, from which the clinician finally selects an appropriate segment covered by the gliom. Thus, the overall glioma segmentation turns into an efficient, nearly real time process with intuitive and usefully restricted user interaction.},

Thus pedestrian movement dynamics on stairways has attracted researchers from different disciplines. As a result of the geometric constraints of the stairs, pedestrian movement features on stairways are different from level ambulation. However, most current modeling pedestrian models for stairway movement have not taken into account the constraints of stairs. In the present study, a computer simulation model named Pedestrian Footstep Model is formulated. In this model, the tread depth and riser height together determine a pedestrian's footstep length, which finally affects the actual movement speed that a pedestrian can achieve. In this way, the model cannot only simulate pedestrian movement on stairs but also on horizontal ground. Dynamics of pedestrian crowd movement process are explored considering different stair geometry features, floor height and flow situations.},

  abstract      = {In a crowd, individuals make different motion choices such as "moving to destination," "following another pedestrian," and "making a detour." For the sake of convenience, the three direction choices are respectively called destination direction, following direction, and detour direction in this paper. Here, it is found that the featured direction choices could be inspired by the shape characteristics of the Voronoi diagram. To be specific, in the Voronoi cell of a pedestrian, the direction to a Voronoi node is regarded as a potential "detour" direction and the direction perpendicular to a Voronoi link is regarded as a potential "following" direction. A pedestrian generally owns several alternative Voronoi nodes and Voronoi links in a Voronoi cell, and the optimal detour and following direction are determined by considering related factors such as deviation. Plus the destination direction which is directly pointing to the destination, the three basic direction choices are defined in a Voronoi cell. In order to evaluate the Voronoi diagram based basic directions, the empirical trajectory data in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments are extracted. A time series method considering the step frequency is used to reduce the original trajectories' swaying phenomena which might disturb the recognition of actual forward direction. The deviations between the empirical velocity direction and the basic directions are investigated, and each velocity direction is classified into a basic direction or regarded as an inexplicable direction according to the deviations. The analysis results show that each basic direction could be a potential direction choice for a pedestrian. The combination of the three basic directions could cover most empirical velocity direction choices in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments.},

  abstract      = {Being determined by human social behaviour, pedestrian group dynamics may depend on 'intrinsic properties' such as the purpose of the pedestrians, their personal relation, gender, age, and body size. In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of pedestrian dyads (distance, spatial formation and velocity) by analysing a large data set of automatically tracked pedestrian trajectories in an unconstrained 'ecological' setting (a shopping mall), whose apparent physical and social group properties have been analysed by three different human coders. We observed that females walk slower and closer than males, that workers walk faster, at a larger distance and more abreast than leisure oriented people, and that inter-group relation has a strong effect on group structure, with couples walking very close and abreast, colleagues walking at a larger distance, and friends walking more abreast than family members. Pedestrian height (obtained automatically through our tracking system) influences velocity and abreast distance, both growing functions of the average group height. Results regarding pedestrian age show that elderly people walk slowly, while active age adults walk at the maximum velocity. Groups with children have a strong tendency to walk in a non-abreast formation, with a large distance (despite a low abreast distance). A cross-analysis of the interplay between these intrinsic features, taking in account also the effect of an 'extrinsic property' such as crowd density, confirms these major results but reveals also a richer structure. An interesting and unexpected result, for example, is that the velocity of groups with children increases with density, at least in the low-medium density range found under normal conditions in shopping malls. Children also appear to behave differently according to the gender of the parent.},

  abstract  = {This article is on collective phenomena in pedestrian dynamics during the assembling and dispersal of gatherings. To date pedestrian dynamics have been primarily studied in the natural and engineering sciences. Pedestrians are analyzed and modeled as driven particles revealing self-organizing phenomena and complex transport characteristics. However, pedestrians in crowds also behave as living beings according to stimulus-response mechanisms or act as human subjects on the basis of social norms, social identities or strategies. To show where pedestrian dynamics need social psychology in addition to the natural sciences we propose the application of three categories --- phenomena, behavior and action. They permit a clear discrimination between situations in which minimal models from the natural sciences are appropriate and those in which sociological and psychological concepts are needed. To demonstrate the necessity of this framework, an experiment in which a large group of people (n = 270) enters a concert hall through two different spatial barrier structures is analyzed. These two structures correspond to everyday situations such as boarding trains and access to immigration desks. Methods from the natural and social sciences are applied. Firstly, physical measurements show the influence of the spatial structure on the dynamics of the entrance procedure. Density, waiting time and speed of progress show large variations. Secondly, a questionnaire study (n = 60) reveals how people perceive and evaluate these entrance situations. Markedly different expectations, social norms and strategies are associated with the two spatial structures. The results from the questionnaire study do not always conform to objective physical measures, indicating the limitations of models which are based on objective physical measures alone and which neglect subjective perspectives.},

the main hypothesis of the study was that in a repeated use of a public
space, people tend to occupy the same position, thus establishing a form of
territoriality. Student seating locations were observed in two university lecture
halls, 6 times during a span of 4 weeks. Observations were carried out
on a sample of 47 and 31 students for Lecture Halls A and B, respectively.
Two parameters were computed: mean displacement and mean territory
dimension. The results showed very low mean displacements in both halls
and the establishment of very small territories inside the halls. The results
are explained in terms of conflict and anxiety avoidance, and the interaction
between spatial preference and goal fulfillment driven by motivational and
personality factors.},

Australian passenger experiences, perceptions of, and their reactions to crowding are not well understood. To gain an understanding of passenger perceptions and tolerance of railway crowding and the impact of passenger behaviour on the crowding experience, qualitative (Stage 1) and quantitative (Stage 2) fieldwork was undertaken between 2009 and 2010 across the five metropolitan railways in Australia. Some results from Stage 1, a two-part qualitative study are given. This involved ethnographic participant observations on trains in five States and 20 focus groups with a total of 179 Australian rail passengers. Focus group participants discussed their reactions to being in close proximity to others in a closed environment and these are examined. This paper will explore the ways in which passengers experience, tolerate and construct perceptions of crowdedness through both avoidance techniques and interactions with fellow passengers.},

  abstract = {The current study set out to evaluate how individuals walk through apertures created by different stationary obstacles. Specifically, we examined whether the passability of apertures differed between human and pole obstacles by quantifying aperture crossing behaviors such as the critical point. Participants walked an 8m path toward a visible goal located at the end. Two obstacles were positioned 5m from the starting location and participants were instructed to pass between the obstacles without hitting them. The distance between the obstacles ranged between 1.0 and 1.8x the participant's shoulder width. Results revealed that, when the obstacles were humans, individuals rotated their shoulders more frequently at larger apertures, as evidenced by a larger critical point (1.7 vs 1.3 for poles), initiated shoulder rotations earlier, rotated to a larger degree, left a wider clearance between their shoulders and the obstacles at the time of crossing, and walked slower when approaching and passing through the obstacles compared to when the obstacles were poles. Furthermore, correlational analyses revealed that the amount of change between an individual's critical point for the poles and the critical point for the human obstacles was related to social risk-taking and changes in walking speed. Therefore, it appears that the passability of apertures changes when walking between two people versus two objects such that more space and greater caution are needed for human obstacles. It is possible that the greater caution observed for human obstacles is to account for the personal space needs of others that do not exist in the same extent for poles and that the degree of caution is related to social factors.},

To find the shortest travel time to a target, a common technique is to solve the eikonal equation on a mesh. We propose EikMesh, an extension of the DistMesh algorithm. EikMesh is a fast parallel mesh generator that reduces the number of mesh points, and thus the computation time, while maintaining precision of numerical solvers on the mesh. It automatically refines where desired, in our case, where the eikonal equation undergoes changes, e.g. near obstacles. The first crucial step is the generation of a sophisticated initial mesh which reduces the number of smoothing steps. In addition, EikMesh avoids expensive Delaunay-re-triangulations. Space filling curves manage storage space in a cache-friendly manner. EikMesh scales better than the parallelized traditional DistMesh and significantly outperforms it for a number of test cases.},

  volume   = {27},
  abstract = {Numerical approximation methods for the Koopman operator have advanced considerably in the last few years. In particular, data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)51 and its generalization, the extended-DMD (EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD improves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of dictionary of observables which spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the Koopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the solution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman formalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying the method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve convergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult for high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ ideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an iterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable dictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing oscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky partical differential equation as examples, we show that our algorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the problem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to choose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy, we require fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries. This alleviates an important shortcoming of the EDMD algorithm and enhances the applicability of the Koopman framework to practical problems.
Every dynamical system has an associated Koopman operator, which encodes many important properties of the system. Most notably, it characterizes the temporal evolution of observables by linear, albeit infinite-dimensional, dynamics even when the underlying dynamical system is non-linear. In recent years, the growing availability of data and novel numerical techniques have enabled us to study this operator computationally. Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is one such technique for approximating the spectral properties of the operator. While effective for some problems, a clear drawback of EDMD is the requirement to select a priori a suitably efficient collection of basis functions, called a dictionary. In this paper, we use ideas from machine learning to optimally adapt the dictionary to data. This enables us to obtain improved numerical approximations without resorting to large dictionary sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by approximating the Koopman operator for the Duffing oscillator system and also the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky partial differential equation (PDE).},

  abstract   = {Pedestrian behavior is an omnipresent topic, but the underlying cognitive processes and the various influences on movement behavior are still not fully understood. Nonetheless, computational simulations that predict crowd behavior are essential for safety, economics, and transport. Contemporary approaches of pedestrian behavior modeling focus strongly on the movement aspects and seldom address the rich body of research from cognitive science. Similarly, general purpose cognitive architectures are not suitable for agents that can move in spatial domains because they do not consider the profound findings of pedestrian dynamics research. Thus, multi-agent simulations of crowd behavior that strongly incorporate both research domains have not yet been fully realized. Here, we propose the cognitive agent framework Spice. The framework provides an approach to structure pedestrian agent models by integrating concepts of pedestrian dynamics and cognition. Further, we provide a model that implements the framework. The model solves spatial sequential choice problems in sufficient detail, including movement and cognition aspects. We apply the model in a computer simulation and validate the Spice approach by means of data from an uncontrolled field study. The Spice framework is an important starting point for further research, as we believe that fostering interdisciplinary modeling approaches will be highly beneficial to the field of pedestrian dynamics.},

investigated the behavioural effects that a shared social
identity has on crowd movement at a pedestrian level. To
investigate the direction and extent to which social identity
influences the movement of crowds, 280 trajectories were
tracked as participants walked in one of two conditions:
(1) a psychological crowd primed to share a social identity;
(2) a naturally occurring physical crowd. Behaviour
was compared both within and between the conditions.
In comparison to the physical crowd, members of the
psychological crowd (i) walked slower, (ii) walked further, and
(iii) maintained closer proximity. In addition, pedestrians who
had to manoeuvre around the psychological crowd behaved
differently to pedestrians who had to manoeuvre past the
naturally occurring crowd. We conclude that the behavioural
differences between physical and psychological crowds must
be taken into account when considering crowd behaviour in
event safety management and computer models of crowds.},

Affiliation, activated by threat, results in individuals seeking the proximity of attachment figures (i.e. family members, friends, colleagues, strangers, social groups, familiar places, and objects). This affects the actions, directions, and speeds adopted by individuals seeking safe areas. This paper presents SOLACE, a multi-agent model of human behaviour during seismic crisis based on social attachment theory. SOLACE is an attempt to show the effect of social attachment on the number of victims, and the time that it takes, to reach a safe area; this increases the realism in evacuation modelling. Real-geographic data are used to define the spatial context of the crisis environment, delimit mobility with barriers (e.g. buildings, debris), and constrain movement to freespace. A belief, desire, and intention (BDI) approach was adopted to integrate social bonds in human agent interaction and mobility. Initial results include realism in: (1) the synthetic crisis environment indicated by a power law distribution of earthquake effects: (a) intensities on buildings and shaking felt by human agents, and (b) evacuation delay, (2) agent movement and interaction (e.g. parent with child) influencing speed of evacuation.},

To curb the resulting complexity of models, Axelrod promoted the KISS principle: 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'.

Richer models were thus developed for a variety of phenomena, while agent cognition still tends to be modelled with simple reactive particle-like agents. This is not always appropriate, in particular in the social sciences trying to account for the complexity of human behaviour. One solution is to model humans as belief, desire and intention (BDI) agents, an expressive paradigm using concepts from folk psychology, making it easier for modellers and users to understand the simulation. This paper provides a methodological guide to the use of BDI agents in social simulations, and an overview of existing methodologies and tools for using them.},

  abstract = {The study of the discharge of active or self-driven matter in narrow passages has become of the growing interest in a variety of fields. The question has particularly important practical applications for the safety of pedestrian human flows notably in emergency scenarios. It has been suggested predominantly through simulation in some theoretical studies as well as through few experimentations that under certain circumstances, an elevated vigour to escape may exacerbate the outflow and cause further delay although the experimental evidence is rather mixed. The dimensions of this complex phenomenon known as the "faster-is slower" effect are of crucial importance to be understood owing to its potential practical implications for the emergency management. The contextual requirements of observing this phenomenon are yet to be identified. It is not clear whether a "do not speed up" policy is universally beneficial and advisable in an evacuation scenario. Here for the first time we experimentally examine this phenomenon in relation to the pedestrian flows at merging sections as a common geometric feature of crowd egress. Various merging angles and three different speed regimes were examined in high-density laboratory experiments. The measurements of flow interruptions and egress efficiency all indicated that the pedestrians were discharged faster when moving at elevated speed levels. We also observed clear dependencies between the discharge rate and the physical layout of the merging with certain designs clearly outperforming others. But regardless of the design, we observed faster throughput and greater avalanche sizes when we instructed pedestrians to run. Our results give the suggestion that observation of the faster-is-slower effect may necessitate certain critical conditions including passages being overly narrow relative to the size of participles (pedestrians) to create long-lasting blockages. The faster-is-slower assumption may not be universal and there may be circumstances where faster is, in fact, faster for evacuees. In the light of these findings, we suggest that it is important to identify and formulate those conditions so they can be disentangled from one another in the models. Misguided overgeneralisations may have unintended adverse ramifications for the safe evacuation management, and this highlights the need for further exploration of this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Methane gas hydrates have increasingly become a topic of interest because of their potential as a future energy resource. There are significant economical and environmental risks associated with extraction from hydrate reservoirs, so a variety of multiphysics models have been developed to analyze prospective risks and benefits. These models generally have a large number of empirical parameters which are not known a priori. Traditional optimization-based parameter estimation frameworks may be ill-posed or computationally prohibitive. Bayesian inference methods have increasingly been found effective for estimating parameters in complex geophysical systems. These methods often are not viable in cases of computationally expensive models and high-dimensional parameter spaces. Recently, methods have been developed to effectively reduce the dimension of Bayesian inverse problems by identifying low-dimensional structures that are most informed by data. Active subspaces is one of the most generally applicable methods of performing this dimension reduction. In this paper, Bayesian inference of the parameters of a state-of-the-art mathematical model for methane hydrates based on experimental data from a triaxial compression test with gas hydrate-bearing sand is performed in an efficient way by utilizing active subspaces. Active subspaces are used to identify low-dimensional structure in the parameter space which is exploited by generating a cheap regression-based surrogate model and implementing a modified Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Posterior densities having means that match the experimental data are approximated in a computationally efficient way.},

behaviors in the presence of real and virtual obstacles, and
in the presence of anthropomorphic and inanimate objects. Precisely,
the results showed a decrease of walking speed as well as
an increase of the clearance distance (i. e., the minimal distance between
the walker and the obstacle) when facing virtual obstacles
compared to real ones. Moreover, our results suggest that users
act differently due to their perception of the obstacle: users keep
more distance when the obstacle is anthropomorphic compared to
an inanimate object and when the orientation of anthropomorphic
obstacle is from the profile compared to a front position. We discuss
implications on future large shared immersive projection spaces.},

The initialization of pedestrian position, path navigation, and goal selection in the improved social force model was guided by real video data. To initialize pedestrian position and determine path navigation, the distribution of the pedestrians is set according to the real video. We also extracted the trajectories of pedestrian movement from the videos, and these trajectories were stored into a path set to guide the evacuation of pedestrians. Moreover, a fitness function was defined to model the behavior of a pedestrian goal selection. The fitness function could process the evacuation parameters, which were extracted from the video, and consider the degree and distance of exit congestion. Furthermore, we quantified the relationship values among pedestrians, and a new force called group force was added to the primary social force model. Pedestrians with close relationship gathered into one group and walked together. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the video data-driven model was applied to simulate campus halls and roads. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is consistent with real-world situations and can assist in analyzing evacuation scenarios.},

In this model, pedestrian movement governed by the static and dynamic floor field, and the motion and assault of artificial attacker were involved simultaneously. Further, injuries with lower velocity and deaths of pedestrians caused by the attacker during evacuation were considered. And a new parameter ktwas introduced. It is the sensitivity coefficient of attack threat floor field and could reflect quantitatively the extent of effect of attack threat on the decision-making of the individual. Moreover, effects of several key parameters such as the sensitivity coefficient, assault intensity and pedestrian density on evacuation dynamics were studied. Results show that pedestrian evacuation would display interesting phenomena transiting from rolling behavior to along-the-wall motion with aggravating extent of the impact of attackers on pedestrians, which refers ktin the model varying from 0.5 to 0.8. As assault intensity increases, more casualties would be caused and the available evacuation time would decrease, which means people have to flee the room in a shorter time period for survival. When the pedestrian density increases, more clogging at the exit would be generated and pedestrians would be more difficult to evacuate due to the limited capacity of egress and the reduction in the average speed of pedestrian flow caused by the injured. And the injured with limited motion capacity could hardly complete the evacuation owing to that they need more evacuation time and would retard the speed of the pedestrian flow.},

  abstract  = {In most existing pedestrian dynamic models, agents are modeled as sliding or jumping objects. As a kind of bipedal creature, however, this assumption makes it difficult to include some important human walking characteristics in the models, such as the periodicity of stepping, the adjustment of step frequency and step length, and the change of personal space within the same step cycle. To take these characteristics into consideration, a biped model is developed to simulate pedestrian locomotion by physical step rather than by time step. The model consists of two components: the stepping simulator and the adjustment of velocity for each step. Simulation results show that the velocity-density relations are consistent with the empirical data. Stable stop-and -go waves are simulated with a critical density. Furthermore, with the considering of biped movement, the lock-step phenomenon is reproduced. The model provides new possibilities to study crowd behavior while considering personal bipedal mechanics.},

community resilience as the absence of illness, as the opposite of vulnerability, as a static and unchanging element, or in a circular way as both a cause and an
outcome. By contrast, some documents avoid generalizations and focus more specifically on the concept's behavioural, relational, cognitive, and psychological aspects.
We discuss the implications of different conceptualizations of community resilience for its operationalization by policymakers and practitioners.},

Common fate seems to operate in sudden impact disasters (e.g., bombings), but to our knowledge, no research has explored social identity processes in rising-tide incidents. We interviewed an opportunity sample of 17 residents of York, United Kingdom, who were involved in the 2015-2016 floods.
Using thematic and discourse analysis, we investigated residents' experiences of the floods and the strategic function that invocations of community identities perform. 
We show how shared community identities emerged (e.g., because of shared problems, shared goals, perceptions of vulnerability, and collapse of previous group boundaries) and show how they acted as a basis of social support (both given and expected). The findings serve to further develop the social identity model of collective psychosocial resilience in rising tide disasters. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.},

Understanding is sought by relating intra- and inter-individual levels of behaviour generation with behaviour pattern emergence at group level.

  url      = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05141},
  abstract = {Path planning for walking characters in complicated virtual environments is a fundamental task in simulations and games. A navigation mesh is a data structure that allows efficient path planning. The Explicit Corridor Map (ECM) is a navigation mesh based on the medial axis. It enables path planning for disk-shaped characters of any radius.
In this paper, we formally extend the medial axis (and therefore the ECM) to 3D environments in which characters are constrained to walkable surfaces. Typical examples of such environments are multi-storey buildings, train stations, and sports stadiums. We give improved definitions of a walkable environment (WE: a description of walkable surfaces in 3D) and a multi-layered environment (MLE: a subdivision of a WE into connected layers). We define the medial axis of such environments based on projected distances on the ground plane. For an MLE with n boundary vertices and k connections, we show that the medial axis has size O(n), and we present an improved algorithm that constructs the medial axis in O(nlognlogk) time.
The medial axis can be annotated with nearest-obstacle information to obtain the ECM navigation mesh. Our implementations show that the ECM can be computed efficiently for large 2D and multi-layered environments, and that it can be used to compute paths within milliseconds. This enables simulations of large virtual crowds of heterogeneous characters in real-time.},

Such experiments give us the opportunity to selectively analyse parameters independent of undesired influences and adjust them to high densities seldom seen in field studies. For the T-junction the density inside the junction has been varied and analysed. Two strategies for the time-efficient automatic extraction of accurate pedestrian trajectories from stereo recordings are presented. One strategy uses marker for detection and the other one based on a perspective depth field. From these trajectories the fundamental diagram of T-junction flow is analysed, the density, velocity and specific flow profiles are obtained using the Voronoi method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is introduced for the simulation of pedestrian groups. Unlike other solutions, where the behaviors of the pedestrians are coded in the system, in our approach the agents learn by interacting with the environment. The embodied agents must learn to control their velocity, avoiding obstacles and the other pedestrians, to reach a goal inside the scenario. The main contribution of this paper is to propose this new methodology that uses different iterative learning strategies, combining a vector quantization (state space generalization) with the Q-learning algorithm (VQQL). Two algorithmic schemas, Iterative VQQL and Incremental, which differ in the way of addressing the problems, have been designed and used with and without transfer of knowledge. These algorithms are tested and compared with the VQQL algorithm as a baseline in two scenarios where agents need to solve well-known problems in pedestrian modeling. In the first, agents in a closed room need to reach the unique exit producing and solving a bottleneck. In in the second, two groups of agents inside a corridor need to reach their goal that is placed in opposite sides (they need to solve the crossing). In the first scenario, we focus on scalability, use metrics from the pedestrian modeling field, and compare with the Helbing's social force model. The emergence of collective behaviors, that is, the shell-shaped clogging in front of the exit in the first scenario, and the lane formation as a solution to the problem of the crossing, have been obtained and analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemas find policies that carry out the tasks, suggesting that they are applicable and generalizable to the simulation of pedestrians groups.},

these robots need to understand and comply with mutually accepted rules. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
model the cooperative navigation behavior of humans. We model their behavior in terms of a mixture distribution that
captures both the discrete navigation decisions, such as going left or going right, as well as the natural variance of human
trajectories. Our approach learns the model parameters of this distribution that match, in expectation, the observed behavior in terms of user-defined features. To compute the feature expectations over the resulting high-dimensional continuous
distributions, we use Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Furthermore, we rely on a Voronoi graph of the
environment to efficiently explore the space of trajectories from the robot'scurrent position to its target position. Using the
proposed model, our method is able to imitate the behavior of pedestrians or, alternatively, to replicate a specific behavior
that was taught by tele-operation in the target environment of the robot. We implemented our approach on a real mobile
robot and demonstrated that it is able to successfully navigate in an office environment in the presence of humans. An
extensive set of experiments suggests that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods to model the behavior of
pedestrians, which also makes it applicable to fields such as behavioral science or computer graphics.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian simulation is complex because there are different levels of behavior modeling.
At the lowest level, local interactions between agents occur; at the middle level, strategic
and tactical behaviors appear like overtakings or route choices; and at the highest level
path-planning is necessary. The agent-based pedestrian simulators either focus on a specific level (mainly in the lower one) or define strategies like the layered architectures to
independently manage the different behavioral levels. In our Multi-Agent Reinforcement-Learning-based Pedestrian simulation framework (MARL-Ped) the situation is
addressed as a whole. Each embodied agent uses a model-free Reinforcement Learning
(RL) algorithm to learn autonomously to navigate in the virtual environment. The main
goal of this work is to demonstrate empirically that MARL-Ped generates learned behaviors
adapted to the level required by the pedestrian scenario. Three different experiments,
described in the pedestrian modeling literature, are presented to test our approach: (i)
election of the shortest path vs. quickest path; (ii) a crossing between two groups of pedestrians walking in opposite directions inside a narrow corridor; (iii) two agents that move in
opposite directions inside a maze. The results show that MARL-Ped solves the different
problems, learning individual behaviors with characteristics of pedestrians (local control
that produces adequate fundamental diagrams, route-choice capability, emergence of
collective behaviors and path-planning). Besides, we compared our model with that of Helbing's social forces, a well-known model of pedestrians, showing similarities between the
pedestrian dynamics generated by both approaches. These results demonstrate empirically
that MARL-Ped generates variate plausible behaviors, producing human-like macroscopic
pedestrian flow.},

Motivated by the successful demonstrations of learning of Atari games and Go by Google DeepMind, we propose a framework for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular relevance as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem due to strong interactions with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As it is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we provide a short overview of deep reinforcement learning and then describe our proposed framework. It incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.},

Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.},

In this paper, our proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the safety and efficiency of the behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning. The real-world deployment also shows that our method is capable of guiding autonomous vehicles to navigate in a socially compliant manner directly through raw depth inputs. In addition, we release a simulation plugin for modeling pedestrian behaviors based on the social force model.},

  abstract = {Many robotic applications require repeated, on-demand motion planning in mapped environments. In addition, the presence of other dynamic agents, such as people, often induces frequent, dynamic changes in the environment. Having a potential function that encodes pairwise cost-to-go can be useful for improving the computational speed of finding feasible paths, and for guiding local searches around dynamic obstacles. However, since storing pairwise potential can be impractical given the O(|V|2) memory requirement, existing work often needs to compute a potential function for each query to a new goal, which would require a substantial online computation. This work addresses the problem by using diffusion maps, a machine learning algorithm, to learn the map's geometry and develop a memory-efficient parametrization (O(|V|)) of pairwise potentials. Specially, each state in the map is transformed to a diffusion coordinate, in which pairwise Euclidean distance is shown to be a meaningful similarity metric. We develop diffusion-based motion planning algorithms and, through extensive numerical evaluation, show that the proposed algorithms find feasible paths of similar quality with orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed compared with single-query methods. The proposed algorithms are implemented on hardware to enable real-time autonomous navigation in an indoor environment with frequent interactions with pedestrians.},

  abstract = {Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. One of the key difficulties is insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust policies. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for their own sake rather than to directly solve external goals. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical action-value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with goal-driven intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level q-value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, while a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse and delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process with stochastic transitions, and (2) the classic ATARI game -- `Montezuma's Revenge'.},

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

  abstract = {Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning rule includes an additional term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Preliminary results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma (IPD), while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to infinitely repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents can successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the likelihood ratio policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for model-free reinforcement learning. This method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. We also apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using deep recurrent policies and opponent modelling. Again, by explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of self-interest.},

  abstract = {The increasing number of mass events involving large crowds calls for a better understanding of the dynamics of dense crowds. Inquiring into the possibility of a mechanical description of these dynamics, we experimentally study the crossing of dense static crowds by a cylindrical intruder, a mechanical test which is classical for granular matter. The analysis of our experiments reveals robust features in the crowd' response, comprising both similarities and discrepancies with the response of granular media. Common features include the presence of a depleted region behind the intruder and the short-range character of the perturbation. On the other hand, unlike grains, pedestrians anticipate the intruder's passage by moving much before contact and their displacements are mostly lateral, hence not aligned with the forces exerted by the intruder. Similar conclusions are reached when the intruder is not a cylinder, but a single crossing pedestrian. Thus, our work shows that pedestrian interactions even at high densities (3 to 6 ped/m2) do not reduce to mechanical ones. More generally, the avoidance strategies evidenced by our findings question the incautious use of force models for dense crowds.},
  comment  = {<note author="gk"> The paper is very simple in its approach but with far reaching consequences. Sending an intruder, more precisely a moving pillar and later a person through a crowd, much in the way experiments with grains are set up, reveals patterns in the crowd density and the velocity fields that differ fundamentally from those observed when in an intrusive object is moved through granular matter. Forces rule in the agglomeration of grains. Force models reproduce very well the compression and flow within the granular matter. Force models do NOT reproduce the compression and flow in a crowd. Unlike grains, people anticipate and evade cleverly before they are pushed away by a force. Hence the paper warns about the uncautious use of force models for crowds. </note>},

  title         = {Simulating Indoor Evacuation of Pedestrians: The Sensitivity of Predictions to Directional-Choice Calibration Parameters},
  journal       = {Transportation Research Record},
  year          = {2018},
  doi           = {10.1177/0361198118796351},
  abstract      = {The increasing occurrence of safety-related incidents like fire and terror attacks in crowded public facilities and mass gatherings has heightened the importance of planning for efficient evacuations through optimizing evacuation routes and architectural designs. This calls for the development of simulation and analytical tools that can replicate occupants' responses and thereby their most likely movement patterns. Such models must be accurate to prevent inappropriate design and planning. One major factor connected to prediction accuracy is the sensitivity of modeling outputs to the value of their various parameters. We report on implementation of a calibrated model of directional choices in a microscopic simulation model of pedestrians' evacuation. We show how estimates of the aggregate measures of prediction are sensitive to the parameters of this tactical level (i.e., directional choice) model. Results demonstrate that the prediction of the total evacuation time and average individual evacuation times are closely correlated with one another in terms of their variation, and are both very sensitive to the specification of each directional choice parameter. Simulated evacuation time could vary up to nearly 30% depending on parameter values. The observed sensitivity highlighted the significance of importing well-calibrated parameters into such simulation models and practicing consistent degrees of accuracy for all levels of decision modeling. We also inferred that the two aggregate measures (i.e., total evacuation time and average individual evacuation times) can be used interchangeably as the basis for evacuation optimization or sensitivity analysis practices.

The design of efficient evacuation plans and accessing accurate estimates of evacuation times have become major concerns related to the safety of crowded public facilities, high-rise buildings, and mass gatherings (1, 2). Attention to this problem has heightened as a result of the increasing occurrence of emergency incidents in such environments within recent years (3). Research on this problem has grown at a fast pace aiming at developing simulation and optimization tools for supporting fast discharge of occupants (4, 5). Such simulation models are meant to allow planners to evaluate the efficiency of their evacuation plans and the architectural design of facilities, perform reliable risk analysis, and identify problematic locations and critical crowding levels.

The accuracy of such models has always been a major issue given the potential ramifications of inappropriate design or poor planning in this context. Clearly, the accuracy of such models relies heavily on how accurately they replicate the element of human behavior. This has particularly been a significant modeling aspect for the microscopic simulation models that attempt to replicate evacuation patterns by simulating individuals' behavior (as happens in reality) (6).

The paucity of data and observations in this particular context has been regarded as a major obstacle towards calibrating and validating many of the existing methodologies and heuristic approaches (7, 8). To address this challenge, one has to resort either to the available field observations from previous emergency incidents (e.g., from CCTV footage) or to collect data in experimental settings. Both approaches, however, pose their own challenges.

While observations from naturally-occurring emergencies are valued for their realism (9, 10), they are rarely accessible to researchers or do not provide sufficient material for modeling or model calibration. Such observations are often one-off and do not offer replications, and the analyst does not have any influence on the observations and thus cannot manipulate any factor for a systematic analysis of a specific phenomenon. They also may be subject to high levels of measurement error (e.g., due to low quality or limited coverage of recorded images).

On the other hand, experimental data provides greater flexibility in that the analyst is in charge of all control factors and can vary them through efficient designs and observe the behavior systematically (11-15). Measurement errors can be kept to a minimum level, and the analyst can replicate the experiments multiple times and draw robust inferences. The major issue is how realistically the context of an experiment can represent a case of an emergency (16). There are certainly limits to how realistic an experiment of evacuation behavior could be, given the ethical and safety restrictions.

A number of authors in this field have suggested that the aspects of the human behavior that need to be investigated and modeled could be classified into three levels of decision making (17-20): (a) occupants' reaction times and pre-evacuation activities, known as "strategic" decisions, (b) their directional route choices, known as "tactical" decisions, and (c) their momentary step choices to avoid collision, known as "operational" decisions. It is clear that accurate modeling in this context necessitates consistent modeling accuracy at all three levels.

In a recent review of the empirical studies in this field, Haghani and Sarvi (21) quantitatively showed that studies related to operational (also known as "walking behavior") models greatly outnumber studies that have addressed the two other aspects of evacuation modeling. Well-functioning and data-supported walking models have been proposed that can adequately replicate the step choices of evacuees (given their directional preferences) (22-24). How occupants make their directional choices has been much less understood, however (25-27). A number of studies have resorted to pure theoretical or modeler-defined assumptions for this aspect (28-31). In the absence of empirical observations, however, one may question the accuracy of such assumptions which could often be quite arbitrary. This could be partly attributed to the greater challenges involved in experimenting with the strategic and tactical levels of decision making as opposed to observing and analyzing pedestrians' walking.

In a recent literature survey, Haghani and Sarvi (21) reviewed the possible relevant data collection methods in this context and identified seven major empirical methods in their categorization: (1) animal crowd experiments (32, 33), (2) virtual reality experiments, (3) controlled laboratory experiments with human crowds, (4) evacuation drills in real buildings, (5) video analysis of naturally-occurring emergencies, (6) video analysis of natural walking, and (7) interview surveys with survivors of mass emergencies. They discussed the advantages and disadvantages offered by each class of data collection and also determined that each class only provides data for particular levels of escape decision making that we categorized earlier.

For the particular problem of directional choices, laboratory experiments with human crowds (34), virtual reality experiments (27, 35), and evacuation drills (36) have proven most popular in former studies. Experiments with human crowds in artificial environments, in particular, have been regarded as a reasonable compromise between the level of contextual realism and the level of controllability. Despite the great efforts that have been made in recent studies, a missing element has been experimental design and analysis at the level of individuals, as previous studies have predominantly been based on the analysis of aggregate (or macroscopic) measures of behavior (26, 37, 38). Although useful insight can still be inferred from such aggregate measures, this common feature of the past studies has partly hindered the derivation of behavioral models suitable for microscopic simulation models.

In this study, we report on a series of controlled laboratory experiments with human crowds dedicated to wayfinding and directional choice behavior. The experimental observations have been extracted at disaggregate (i.e., individual) level from which we derived a multi-variable model of directional choices. The model probabilistically replicates the directional choices by quantifying evacuees' tradeoffs between a number of factors related to the physical architecture of the escape environment (i.e., physical factors) and a number of factors related to peer influence (i.e., social factors). This tactical level model is then integrated with a conventional operational level model of walking to form a bi-layer simulation model of evacuation. We report on sensitivity analyses on the directional choice parameters of this model to examine the sensitivity of system-wise aggregate measures (e.g., total evacuation times) to these calibration parameters.},

In principle, computer simulations offer means to further this understanding. Yet, unlike for many classic dynamical systems in physics, there is no universally accepted locomotion model for crowd dynamics. On the contrary, a multitude 
of approaches, with very different characteristics, compete. Often only the experts in one special model type are able to assess the consequences these characteristics have on a simulation study. Therefore, scientists from all disciplines who 
wish to use simulations to analyze pedestrian dynamics need a tool to compare competing approaches. Developers, too, would profit from an easy way to get insight into an alternative modeling ansatz. Vadere meets this interdisciplinary demand 
by offering an open-source simulation framework that is lightweight in its approach and in its user interface while offering pre-implemented versions of the most widely spread models.},

In the first experiment, a waiting crowd of 13 participants is passed by a walking proband. In the second experiment, a waiting dyad is passed by a walking proband.

  abstract = {Purpose It is of paramount importance to ensure safe and fast evacuation routes in cities in case of natural disasters, environmental accidents or acts of terrorism. The same applies to large-scale events such as concerts, sport events and religious pilgrimages as airports and to traffic hubs such as airports and train stations. The prediction of pedestrian is notoriously difficult because it varies depending on circumstances (age group, cultural characteristics, etc.). In this study, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation technique, which uses the updated observation data to improve the accuracy of the simulation, was applied to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of pedestrian flow. Design/methodology/approach The EnKF, one of the data assimilation techniques, was applied to the in-house numerical simulation code for pedestrian flow. Two cases were studied in this study. One was the simplified one-directional experimental pedestrian flow. The other was the real pedestrian flow at the Kaaba in Mecca. First, numerical simulations were conducted using the empirical input parameter sets. Then, using the observation data, the EnKF estimated the appropriate input parameter sets. Finally, the numerical simulations using the estimated parameter sets were conducted. Findings The EnKF worked on the numerical simulations of pedestrian flow very effectively. In both cases: simplified experiment and real pedestrian flow, the EnKF estimated the proper input parameter sets which greatly improved the accuracy of the numerical simulation. The authors believe that the technique such as EnKF could also be used effectively in other fields of computational engineering where simulations and data have to be merged. Practical implications This technique can be used to improve both design and operational implementations of pedestrian and crowd dynamics predictions. It should be of high interest to command and control centers for large crowd events such as concerts, airports, train stations and pilgrimage centers. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, the data assimilation technique has not been applied to a numerical simulation of pedestrian flow, especially to the real pedestrian flow handling millions pedestrian such as the Mataf at the Kaaba. This study validated the capability and the usefulness of the data assimilation technique to numerical simulations for pedestrian flow.},

  abstract = {The movement of animals in groups is widespread in nature. Understanding this phenomenon presents an important problem in ecology with many applications that range from conservation to robotics. Underlying all group movements are interactions between individual animals and it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanisms of this social behaviour. To date, despite promising methodological developments, there are few applications to data of practical statistical techniques that inferentially investigate the extent and nature of social interactions in group movement. We address this gap by demonstrating the usefulness of a Hidden Markov Model approach to characterise individual-level social movement in published trajectory data on three-spined stickleback shoals (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and novel data on guppy shoals (Poecilia reticulata). With these models, we formally test for speed-mediated social interactions and verify that they are present. We further characterise this inferred social behaviour and find that despite the substantial shoal-level differences in movement dynamics between species, it is qualitatively similar in guppies and sticklebacks. It is intermittent, occurring in varying numbers of individuals at different time points. The speeds of interacting fish follow a bimodal distribution, indicating that they are either stationary or move at a preferred mean speed, and social fish with more social neighbours move at higher speeds, on average. Our findings and methodology present steps towards characterising social behaviour in animal groups.},

The deviation between body orientation and walking direction during collision avoidance was studied by quantitatively evaluating the body rotation for counter-flows in narrow corridors. Simple experiments, in which two pedestrians passed each other, were conducted. It was found that pedestrians rotated their bodies when the corridor width was smaller than the sum of the widths of the two pedestrians. This behavior was explained by analyzing the geometry of two ellipses circumscribing each other in a narrow corridor. A preliminary model was developed, and the deviation between the body orientation and walking direction during passing was successfully simulated. Finally, a cross-flow experiment, which is much more complex and realistic than the passing experiments, was performed; it was confirmed that body rotation behavior is also a critical factor in complex and realistic scenarios.},

  abstract  = {How humans resolve non-trivial tradeoffs in their navigational choices between the social interactions (e.g., the presence and movements of others) and the physical factors (e.g., spatial distances, route visibility) when escaping from threats in crowded confined spaces? The answer to this question has major implications for the planning of evacuations and the safety of mass gatherings as well as the design of built environments. Due to the challenges of collecting behavioral data from naturally-occurring evacuation settings, laboratory-based virtual-evacuation experiments have been practiced in a number of studies. 
This class of experiments faces the traditional question of contextual bias and generalizability: How reliably can we infer humans' behavior from decisions made in hypothetical settings? Here, we address these questions by making a novel link between two different forms of empirical observations. We conduct hypothetical emergency exit-choice experiments framed as simple pictures, and then mimic those hypothetical scenarios in more realistic fashions through staging mock evacuation trials with actual crowds. Econometric choice models are estimated based on the observations made in both experimental contexts. The models are contrasted with each other from a number of perspectives including their predictions as well as the sign, magnitude, statistical significance, person-to-person variations (reflecting individuals' perception/preference differences) and the scale (reflecting context-dependent decision randomness) of their inferred parameters. Results reveal a surprising degree of resemblance between the models derived from the two contexts.
Most strikingly, they produce fairly similar prediction probabilities whose differences average less than 10%. There is also unexpected consensus between the inferences derived from both experimental sources on many aspects of people's behavior notably in terms of the perception of social interactions. Results show that we could have elicited peoples' escape strategies with fair precision without observing them in action (i.e., simply by using only hypothetical-choice data as an inexpensive, practical and non-invasive experimental technique in this context). As a broader application, this offers promising evidence as to the potential applicability of the hypothetical-decision experiments to other decision contexts (at least for non-financial decisions) when field or real-world data is prohibitively unavailable. As a practical application, the behavioral insights inferred from our observations (reflected in the estimated parameters) can improve how accurately we predict the movement patterns of human crowds in emergency scenarios arisen in complex spaces. Fully-generic-in-parameters, our proposed models can even be directly introduced to a broad range of crowd simulation software to replicate navigation decision making of evacuees.},

The central tenet of statistical modelling is to describe the relationship between different variables by using probability distributions. Rather than providing a critique of existing methodology or a "how to" guide for such an established research technique, our review aims to highlight broad concepts, different uses, best practices, challenges and opportunities with a focussed view on theoretical models for pedestrian behaviour. This contribution is aimed at researchers in pedestrian dynamics who want to carefully analyse data, relate a theoretical model to data, or compare the relative quality of several theoretical models. The survey of the literature we present provides many methodological starting points and we suggest that the particular challenges to statistical modelling in pedestrian dynamics make this an inherently interesting field of research.},

  abstract  = {The possibility to understand and to quantitatively model the physics of the interactions between pedestrians walking in crowds has compelling relevant applications, e.g. related to the design and safety of civil infrastructures. In this work we study pedestrian-pedestrian interactions from observational experimental data in diluted crowds. While in motion, pedestrians adapt their walking paths trying to preserve mutual comfort distances and to avoid collisions. In mathematical models this behavior is typically modeled via "social" interaction forces.
Leveraging on a high-quality, high-statistics dataset - composed of few millions of real-life trajectories acquired from state-of-the-art observational experiments - we develop a quantitative model capable of addressing interactions in the case of binary collision avoidance. We model interactions in terms of both long- and short-range forces, which we superimpose to our Langevin model for non-interacting pedestrian motion [Corbetta et al. Phys.Rev.E 95, 032316, 2017]. The new model that we propose here features a Langevin dynamics with "fast" random velocity fluctuations that are superimposed to the "slow" dynamics of a hidden model variable: the "intended" walking path. The model is capable of reproducing relevant statistics of the collision avoidance motion, such as the statistics of the side displacement and of the passing speed. Rare occurrences of bumping events are also recovered.
Furthermore, comparing with large datasets of real-life tracks involves an additional challenge so far neglected: identifying, within a database containing very heterogeneous conditions, only the relevant events corresponding to binary avoidance interactions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach based on a graph representation of pedestrian trajectories, which allows us to operate complexity reduction for efficient data selection.},

It argues that the total evacuation time can be divided into three components: the time to recognize a dangerous situation, the time to decide for evacuation and the time for the movement towards safety. The last component, the egress time, is studied closely in this paper. When the capacity of a walkway is known, this component can be calculated. The capacity however is affected by a number of factors. Through two field studies the effects of the motivation of people to move and the slope of stairs on capacity have been tested. It appears that initially motivation has an accelerating effect, but as the number of people per square meter grows their speed decreases. Also the steeper the slope of stairs, the slower people will move on them. Furthermore the value for capacity used in design and egress time calculations is looked upon. Various researchers have come up with different values. Some recommend the use of the maximum value, which gives the minimum egress time, while others recommend the use of a mean value for capacity, which gives a mean value for egress time. This paper discusses the advantages of the use of a mean value over the use of a maximum value, and thus of the use of an average over a minimum egress time.},

For this aim, observational and experimental study on the single-file movement of pedestrians at different densities is conducted. Methods to measure step length, step frequency, swaying amplitude and step synchronization are proposed by means of trajectories of the head. Mathematical models for the relations of step length or frequency and speed are evaluated. The problem how step length and step duration are influenced by factors like body height and density is investigated. It is shown that the effect of body height on step length and step duration changes with density.

  abstract  = {How to model pedestrian movement is an intriguing problem in the area of statistical physics. As a common phenomenon of pedestrian movement, fatigue has a significant negative effect on pedestrian movement, especially when pedestrians move or run with heavy luggage, rescue the wounded in disaster, climb stairs and etc. According to the field observations and previous researches, fatigue coefficient is defined as the decrease of desired velocity in this study. However, previous researches lacked quantitative analysis of the effect of fatigue on pedestrian speed. It has been a great challenge to study the effect of fatigue on pedestrian flow, since pedestrians of heterogeneous walking abilities and the change of pedestrians moving properties need to be taken into consideration. Thus, at first, a series of pedestrian experiments, under three different conditions, were conducted to formulate the empirical relationship among fatigue, average free velocity, and walking distance. Then the empirical formulation of pedestrian fatigue was imported into the multi-velocity field floor cellular automata (FFCA) model for following pedestrian dynamics analysis. The velocity ratio was adjusted dynamically to adapt the change of pedestrians velocity due to fatigue. The fatigue, entrance flow rate and pedestrian's initial desired velocity are found to have significant effects on the pedestrian flow. The space-time distributions of pedestrian density and velocity were explored in detail, with phase transition analyses from a free flow phase to a congestion phase. Additionally, the  density wave  in the system can be observed if a certain ratio of burdened pedestrians lay in the high density region. The envelope of the  density wave reaches its maximum amplitude around the entrance position, and gradually diminishes away from the entrance.},

experiment is performed for students evacuating from a dormitory with an exit and stairs.
FDS+Evac is proposed to simulate the exit and stair dynamics of occupant evacuation.
Concerning the exit and stair widths, we put forward some useful standpoints. Good
agreement is achieved between the predicted results and experimental results. With the
increase of exit width, a significant stratification phenomenon will be found in flow rate.
Stratification phenomenon is that two different stable flow rates will emerge during the
evacuation. And the flow rate curve looks like a ladder. The larger the exit width, the earlier
the stratification phenomenon appears. When exit width is more than 2.0 m, the flow rate
of each exit width is divided into two stable stages, and the evacuation times show almost
no change. The judgment that the existence of stairs causes flow stratification is reasonable.
By changing the width of the stairs, we proved that judgment. The smaller the width of
BC, the earlier the stratification appears. We found that scenario 5 is the most adverse
circumstance. Those results are helpful in performance-based design of buildings.},

Despite the data demonstrating that panic is a very rare occurrence in fires, the idea of panic and the term continue to be used by the public as well as fire experts. It is therefore necessary to demystify the misconception that panic is an essential element of a fire and identify any scientific justification for continuing to use this concept.},

  abstract = {An appropriate and safe behavior for exiting a facility is key to reducing injuries and increasing survival when facing an emergency evacuation in a building. Knowledge on the best evacuation practice is commonly delivered by traditional training approaches such as videos, posters, or evacuation drills, but they may become ineffective in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention. Serious games (SGs) are an innovative approach devoted to training and educating people in a gaming environment. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based SGs for evacuation knowledge delivery and behavior assessment because they are highly engaging and promote greater cognitive learning. This paper aims to understand the development and implementation of IVR SGs in the context of building evacuation training and research, applied to various indoor emergencies such as fire and earthquake. Thus, a conceptual framework for effective design and implementation through the systematic literature review method was developed. As a result, this framework integrates critical aspects and provides connections between them, including pedagogical and behavioral impacts, gaming environment development, and outcome and participation experience measures.},

This work aims at reviewing existing AR applications developed for building evacuation. This review identifies the disasters and types of building those tools have been applied for.

  abstract = {The most important objective of a fire safety design is to ensure that humans can safely escape from a building in the case of fire. Fire regulations are adequate for normal buildings but may not take into account the special issues of large and complicated buildings, like shopping centres, assembly facilities, etc. Numerical simulation of fire and evacuation processes can be used to improve fire safety in such buildings. However, the usability of many current evacuation models is limited, because they do not take into account the individual properties and decision making processes of humans, the dynamics of large crowds and the interaction between fire and people. In this article, a recently presented evacuation programme is developed further. The code allows the modelling of 'panic' situations and the interaction between evacuation simulation and the state-of-the-art fire simulation. The major features of the human movement algorithm are described. A reaction function model for exit route selection and some social interactions among agents are introduced into the computer programme. This computational tool for evacuation modelling is implemented as a part of the state-of-the-art fire simulation tool Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Like the current version of FDS, the evacuation module, FDS+Evac, presented in this article is made publicly and freely available.},

  abstract  = {The combination of multi-agent technology and reinforcement learning methods has been recognized as an effective way which used in path planning based crowd simulation. However, existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force modelwas improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning, but also improves the convergence speed. The evacuation efficiency is effectively improved in crowd evacuation simulation experiments. In addition, it also can provide specific guidance scheme for crowd evacuation improvement and assistant decision support for the prevention and management of large-scale group trampling incidents.},

Often, train systems are investigated where seat choice may have a great impact on capacity utilization, especially when passengers get in each other's way. Therefore, it is useful to reproduce passengers'  behavior inside trains. However, there is surprisingly little research on the subject. Do passengers distribute evenly as it is most often assumed in simulation models and as one would expect from a system that obeys the laws of thermodynamics? Conversely, is there a higher degree of order? To answer these questions, we collect data on seating behavior in Munich's suburban trains and analyze it. Clear preferences are revealed that contradict the former assumption of a uniform distribution. We subsequently introduce a model that matches the probability distributions we observed. We demonstrate the applicability of our model and present a qualitative validation with a simulation example. The model's implementation is part of the free and open-source Vadere simulation framework for pedestrian dynamics and thus available for further studies. The model can be used as one component in larger systems for the simulation of public transport.},

  abstract = {The possible presence of social groups amongst occupants in indoor 
evacuation scenarios and the potential discrepancies between their behaviour and that 
of single individuals have been acknowledged in the evacuation dynamics literature. 
Yet, empirical studies on the behavioural characteristics of social-group evacuees, 
particularly those related to their decision-making mechanism, are relatively underrepresented. 
This study reports on a lab-in-the-field experiment of evacuations that investigates the effect 
of group size and stress level on multiple aspects of groups' behaviour. 
These aspects include pre-movement time, decision time (i.e. time taken to reach a directional 
exit decision), exit-choice behaviour, exit-choice changing and intra-group decision dynamics. 
Our main findings showed that:
(I)Group size had a significant effect on pre-movement times 
and decision times (and to lesser extent, on evacuation times). 
People took longer to initiate their movement or to make a directional exit decision 
when in groups compared to when acting alone. The influence of group size on pre-movement 
and decision times, however, was not monotonic. For smaller group sizes (sizes 2 and 3), 
pre-movement and decision times increased with the group size. But for the larger 
group size (size 4), the effect was reversed.(II)The exit-choice mechanism of groups, 
overall, showed a great degree of similarity to that of single individuals. 
This suggests that, from a modelling perspective, the directional exit choices of groups 
could be approximated with the models obtained from datasets of individually-made choices.
(III)Groups were more likely to revisit and change their initial exit decisions under 
the higher level of stress. In addition, social influence was a major factor in triggering 
changes in the exit choices of groups. Nearly 50% of the changes in group decisions 
occurred shortly after another neighbour group changed its exit decision. 
In other words, instances of group decision-changing was often followed by another group 
taking a similar action.(IV)As to the within-group dynamics of decision-making, 
our analyses suggested that, regardless of the group size, leadership was the dominant 
group decision-making mechanism (compared to the consensus or the conform-to-majority mechanisms). 
In nearly 50% of the cases, group decisions were made by one individual 
taking the lead and hinting the direction of the movement to other members of the group.},

All the walkers in this experiment were instructed to walk along a circular course unidirectionally. Fundamental diagrams and multiple regression analysis show that the speed at which a particular pedestrian walks is determined by both the local density and the speed at which the surrounding pedestrians are walking. We also find that the spontaneous lane formation, that occurs in bidirectional flow, does not occur in flow in which the speed is heterogeneous, thereby resulting in a spatial density distribution with large variance. This corresponds to pedestrian clustering, which reduces both the mean speed and the flow rate.},

Recently, deep neural networks have successfully been applied to games with discrete actions spaces. However, deep neural networks for discrete actions are not suitable for devising strategies for games where a very small change in an action can dramatically affect the outcome. In this paper, we present a new self-play reinforcement learning framework which equips a continuous search algorithm which enables to search in continuous action spaces with a kernel regression method. Without any hand-crafted features, our network is trained by supervised learning followed by self-play reinforcement learning with a high-fidelity simulator for the Olympic sport of curling. The program trained under our framework outperforms existing programs equipped with several hand-crafted features and won an international digital curling competition.},

The results of the presented experiment suggest that the transition takes place between a corridor width of 1.2 m and 2.3 m. The total duration of each experimental run is not significantly influenced by the corridor width but by the width of the entrance itself, the number of participants and partly by the motivation. In general, the density in front of the gate as well as the area of high density is increased by widening the corridor and by intensifying the motivation of the participants. However, the results also suggest that also the number of participants significantly influences the occurrence of pushing and the level of density.},

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo'sown move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100:0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

  abstract  = {This paper analyzes the emergent behaviors of pedestrian groups that learn through the multiagent reinforcement learning model developed in our group. Five scenarios studied in the pedestrian model literature, and with different levels of complexity, were simulated in order to analyze the robustness and the scalability of the model. Firstly, a reduced group of agents must learn by interaction with the environment in each scenario. In this phase, each agent learns its own kinematic controller, that will drive it at a simulation time. Secondly, the number of simulated agents is increased, in each scenario where agents have previously learnt, to test the appearance of emergent macroscopic behaviors without additional learning. This strategy allows us to evaluate the robustness and the consistency and quality of the learned behaviors. For this purpose several tools from pedestrian dynamics, such as fundamental diagrams and density maps, are used. The results reveal that the developed model is capable of simulating human-like micro and macro pedestrian behaviors for the simulation scenarios studied, including those where the number of pedestrians has been scaled by one order of magnitude with respect to the situation learned.},

  abstract  = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Manual measuring equipment was used for hands, feet, head and stature. As differences between significant measurements in Studies A and B were negligible, the data were merged. Anthropometric descriptive statistics of women and men are presented for 43 body dimensions. Participants represent the Swedish population fairly well when compared with national statistics of stature and weight. Comparing new anthropometric data with old shows that the breadth, depth, height, and length measurements of Swedes as well as weight have increased and that Swedish anthropometric homogeneity has decreased.

However, the computational performance of these models can vary greatly and their relative accuracy is generally unexplored, leaving users with little guidance when selecting a model for their needs. Here, models based on the Social Forces, Optimal Steps, and static graph concepts are coded into MassMotion, then calibrated against observed pedestrian flow data using Genetic Algorithms. Using two transit station scenarios, each model's ability to match observed and increased volume pedestrian flows is explored and their relative speeds are compared, generally showing significant speed advantages over the default MassMotion model, but also indicating that the graph and Optimal Steps models are note sufficiently sensitive to congestion. Additionally, this work explores the behaviour of these models within various facility elements, including corridors, corners, and open spaces.},
  comment     = {<note author="gk">
The author brutalizes the SFM and the OSM in equal manner and compares them to the pre-implemented SFM-type model in the commercial MassMotion tool and a very simple graph based method. He fails to see that the SFM is a set of ODEs that need to be solved numerically using a fine time step. Instead he uses Euler steps of size 0.5 sec. It is a miracle to me why  he does not observe - or report - overlaps. The OSM is "simplified" by dropping its two core characteristics: the natural step size per agent and the natural pace per agent, instead advancing agents each second by the step length they would need in that second to achieve their "current" speed (whatever that may be). The author observes throughput at two stations by counting: with very moderage traffic. All models perform similarily. Then the traffic at the station is increased. In the absence of real data the author declares MassMotion to be the ground truth. Based on that he concludes that only MassMotion and the related brutalized SFM match congestions..... and leaves me baffled.

stairs is usually modeled by slowing down pedestrians by a fixed factor. But is this justified? And what happens
at intermediate landings? This contribution aims to clarify inconclusive results of previous research and provide
new information to directly incorporate empirical results into a parsimonious computer model. The algorithms
are freely available through an open-source framework. After outlining the shortcomings of existing approaches,

  abstract = {Ideally, a multitude of steps has to be taken before a commercial implementation of a pedestrian model is used in practice.
Calibration, the main goal of which is to increase the accuracy of the predictions by determining the set of values for the model
parameters that allows for the best replication of reality, has an important role in this process. Yet, up to recently, calibration has
received relatively little attention within the field of pedestrian modelling. Most studies focus only on one specific movement base
case and/or use a singlemetric. It is questionable how generally applicable a pedestrian simulationmodel is that has been calibrated
using a limited set of movement base cases and one metric. The objective of this research is twofold, namely, to (1) determine the
effect of the choice of movement base cases, metrics, and density levels on the calibration results and (2) to develop a multipleobjective
calibration approach to determine the aforementioned effects. In this paper a multiple-objective calibration scheme is
presented for pedestrian simulation models, in which multiple normalized metrics (i.e., flow, spatial distribution, effort, and travel
time) are combined by means of weighted sum method that accounts for the stochastic nature of themodel. Based on the analysis of
the calibration results, it can be concluded that (1) it is necessary to use multiple movement base cases when calibrating a model to
capture all relevant behaviours, (2) the level of density influences the calibration results, and (3) the choice ofmetric or combinations
of metrics influence the results severely.},

Numerous statistical and probabilistic tools (regression, smoothing, tests, statistical learning, Monte Carlo, {\ldots}) aim at determining the model input variables which mostly contribute to an interest quantity depending on model output. This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable. Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most influential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application. A synthesis is given to place every method according to several axes, mainly the cost in number of model evaluations, the model complexity and the nature of brought information.},

  abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis (SA) aims at quantifying the respective effects of input random variables (or combinations thereof) onto the variance of the response of a physical or mathematical model. Among the abundant literature on sensitivity measures, the Sobol' indices have received much attention since they provide accurate information for most models. The paper introduces generalized polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) to build surrogate models that allow one to compute the Sobol' indices analytically as a post-processing of the PCE coefficients. Thus the computational cost of the sensitivity indices practically reduces to that of estimating the PCE coefficients. An original non intrusive regression-based approach is proposed, together with an experimental design of minimal size. Various application examples illustrate the approach, both from the field of global SA (i.e. well-known benchmark problems) and from the field of stochastic mechanics. The proposed method gives accurate results for various examples that involve up to eight input random variables, at a computational cost which is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the traditional Monte Carlo-based evaluation of the Sobol' indices.},

Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the model building and result communication process. Through sensitivity analysis we gain essential insights on model behavior, on its structure and on its response to changes in the model inputs. Several interrogations are possible and several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed, giving rise to a vast and growing literature. We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado diagrams, one way sensitivity functions, differentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through finite change sensitivity indices, providing a unified view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, first discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis. A classical example is worked out to illustrate some of the approaches.},

moment-independent measures. To this end, this thesis introduces a new global
reliability-sensitivity index based on a modification of the \delta-index by Borgonovo
(2007). In addition, a new computational approach, denoted as Enhanced Adaptive
Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (EAK-MCS), is developed to compute the indices at
the lowest possible costs. The new set of indices is tested and compared against other
established indices on four reliability benchmark problems. Eventually, the convergence of the new computational approach is compared against the ordinary Adaptive
Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) technique. It is concluded that the new
set of indices delivers numerically stable and equivalently ranked index values compared to the existing global indices. In combination with either the AK-MCS or the
EAK-MCS meta-modelling strategy, the indices may be computed with only a few
hundreds of full model evaluations.},

  abstract = {Macroscopic pedestrian models for bidirectional flow analysis encounter limitations in describing microscopic dynamics at crosswalks. Pedestrian behavior at crosswalks is typically characterized by the evasive effect with conflicting pedestrians and vehicles and the following effect with leading pedestrians. This study proposes a hybrid approach (i.e., route search and social force-based approach) for modeling of pedestrian movement at signalized crosswalks. The key influential factors, i.e., leading pedestrians, conflict with opposite pedestrians, collision avoidance with vehicles, and compromise with traffic lights, are considered. Aerial video data collected at one intersection in Beijing, China were recorded and extracted. A new calibration approach based on a genetic algorithm is proposed that enables optimization of the relative error of pedestrian trajectory in two dimensions, i.e., moving distance and angle. Model validation is conducted by comparison with the observed trajectories in five typical cases of pedestrian crossing with or without conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. The characteristics of pedestrian flow, speed, acceleration, pedestrian-vehicle conflict, and the lane formation phenomenon were compared with those from two competitive models, thus demonstrating the advantage of the proposed model.},

  abstract  = {The collective movement of animals in a group is an impressive phenomenon whereby large scale spatio-temporal patterns emerge from simple interactions between individuals. Theoretically, much of our understanding of animal group motion comes from models inspired by statistical physics. In these models, animals are treated as moving (self-propelled) particles that interact with each other according to simple rules. Recently, researchers have shown greater interest in using experimental data to verify which rules are actually implemented by a particular animal species. In our study, we present a rigorous selection between alternative models inspired by the literature for a system of glass prawns. We find that the classic theoretical models can accurately capture either the fine-scale behaviour or the large-scale collective patterns of movement of the prawns. However, none are able to reproduce both levels of description at the same time. To resolve this conflict we introduce a new class of models wherein prawns 'remember', their previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. These outperform the traditional models in predicting when individual prawns will change their direction of motion and restore consistency between the fine-scale rules of interaction and the global behaviour of the group.},

  abstract = {Although various theories have been adopted to develop reliable pedestrian walking models, a limited effort has been made to calibrate them rigorously based on individual trajectories. Most researchers have validated their models by comparing observed and estimated traffic flow parameters such as speed, density, and flow rate, or replaced the validation by visual confirmation of some well-known phenomena such as channelization and platooning. The present study adopted maximum likelihood estimation to calibrate a social-force model based on the observed walking trajectories of pedestrians. The model was assumed to be made up of five components (i.e., inertia, desired direction, leader--follower relationship, collision avoidance, and random error), and their corresponding coefficients represented relative sensitivity. The model also included coefficients for individual-specific characteristics and for a distance-decay relationship between a pedestrian and his/her leaders or colliders. The calibration results varied with the two density levels adopted in the present study. In the case of high density, significant coefficient estimates were found with respect to both the leader--follower relationship and collision avoidance. Collision avoidance did not affect the pedestrian's walking behavior for the low-density case due to channelization. The distance limit was confirmed, within which a pedestrian is affected by neighbors. At the low-density level, by comparison with women, men were found to more actively follow leaders, and pedestrians walking in a party were found to be less sensitive to the motion of leaders at the high-density level.},

The application results provide new insight into the behavior of individual pedestrians, inter-pedestrian differences, as well as the resulting pedestrian flow characteristics. By comparing different models of increasing complexity, it is investigated which of the model amendments are significant from a statistical point of view and which are not. It is shown that besides anisotropy, finite reaction times play an important role in correctly describing microscopic walking behavior. The implications of these findings in the microscopic description of pedestrians flows are considered by studying the predicted flow operations at a narrow bottleneck. It turns out that the finite reaction times have a significant effect on the pedestrian flow operations.},

  abstract = {Automated calibration of microscopic traffic flow models is all but simple for a number of reasons, including the computational complexity of black-box optimization and the asymmetric importance of parameters in influencing model performances. The main objective of this paper is therefore to provide a robust methodology to simplify car-following models, that is, to reduce the number of parameters (to calibrate) without sensibly affecting the capability of reproducing reality. To this aim, variance-based sensitivity analysis is proposed and formulated in a 'factor fixing' setting. Among the novel contributions are a robust design of the Monte Carlo framework that also includes, as an analysis factor, the main nonparametric input of car-following models, i.e., the leader's trajectory, and a set of criteria for 'data assimilation' in car-following models. The methodology was applied to the intelligent driver model (IDM) and to all the trajectories in the 'reconstructed' Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) I80-1 data set. The analysis unveiled that the leader's trajectory is considerably more important than the parameters in affecting the variability of model performances. Sensitivity analysis also returned the importance ranking of the IDM parameters. Basing on this, a simplified model version with three (out of six) parameters is proposed. After calibrations, the full model and the simplified model show comparable performances, in face of a sensibly faster convergence of the simplified version.},

  abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,....,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,...,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,....,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this article, we perform a parameter study for a recently developed karst hydrological model. The study consists of a high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem and a global sensitivity analysis. For the first time in karst hydrology, we use the active subspace method to find directions in the parameter space that dominate the Bayesian update from the prior to the posterior distribution in order to effectively reduce the dimension of the problem and for computational efficiency. Additionally, the calculated active subspace can be exploited to construct sensitivity metrics on each of the individual parameters and be used to construct a natural model surrogate. The model consists of 21 parameters to reproduce the hydrological behavior of spring discharge in a karst aquifer located in the Kerschbaum spring recharge area at Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs in Austria. The experimental spatial and time series data for the inference process were collected by the water works in Waidhofen. We show that this case study has implicit low-dimensionality, and we run an adjusted Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a low-dimensional subspace to construct samples of the posterior distribution. The results are visualized and verified by plots of the posterior's push-forward distribution displaying the uncertainty in predicting discharge values due to the experimental noise in the data. Finally, a discussion provides hydrological interpretation of these results for the Kerschbaum area.},

  abstract   = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

Here, we expose properties of an emergent effect at a macroscopic level, namely interactions between pedestrian streams that arise when pedestrians walk into and through four-way intersections from different directions. We propose non-spatial models for the number of pedestrians from different streams inside an intersection. Each model encodes a different hypothesis for how streams interact and can produce dynamics fundamentally distinct from the other models. By fitting our models to large experimental data sets and determining which model explains the data best, we determine when and how entire streams of pedestrians start to interact. We find that as arrival rates increase, streams start to interact and compete for space. Our results suggest that these interactions result in an even balance of pedestrian numbers across two orthogonally intersecting streams. Neither of the streams can dominate. In contrast, for four intersecting streams, our findings suggest that jams in some streams can coincide with higher flow rates in other streams and that the relative dominance of streams can switch stochastically. By adapting existing methodology, we thus present a coherent conceptual approach for investigating emergent effects in temporal dynamics at aggregated levels in pedestrian flows that could be applied to other scenarios. Our approach is flexible and uses easily measured quantities, making it highly suitable for observational data in different scenarios or deployment in applications.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

  abstract  = {Escape way capacity calculation is an important item to realize safe buildings. In general, evacuation times are predicted by engineering methods with wide varieties in use and results. For example, Nelson defines capacity as a continuous and linear function to the escape way width. Hoogedoorn, however, describes a stepwise discontinuous increasing capacity.
To analyse the problem, a bottleneck experiment with students as test persons was arranged. The bottleneck width was varied in steps of 0.1 m starting with 0.8 m and ending with 1.2 m. The number of test persons was varied between 20, 40 and 60. Commerical DV-cameras recorded the procedure; the interpretation of films was accomplished manually, using a computer display.
The data shows a continuous change of time gaps, speed, density and finally personnel flow in the bottleneck. Furthermore transient phenomenon could be observed. Additionally, screening the video recordings a zipper effect is visible; this means, the persons optimize the density by themselves (see also 4).
In summary the experiment's most important result is the awareness of continuous rise in density, a step by step effect can not be observed- although this is a very popular consideration which can be found even in the German building regulations.},

use the exemplar of a bus route system to explore these methods. The bus route ABMs developed in

  abstract = {Human visual object recognition is typically rapid and seemingly effortless, as well as largely independent of viewpoint and object orientation. Until very recently, animate visual systems were the only ones capable of this remarkable computational feat. This has changed with the rise of a class of computer vision algorithms called deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieve human-level classification performance on object recognition tasks. Furthermore, a growing number of studies report similarities in the way DNNs and the human visual system process objects, suggesting that current DNNs may be good models of human visual object recognition. Yet there clearly exist important architectural and processing differences between state-of-the-art DNNs and the primate visual system. The potential behavioural consequences of these differences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing human and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the human visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast reduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find progressively diverging classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs when the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked differences in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object recognition. We envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured and freely available behavioural datasets provide a new useful benchmark for the computer vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a motivation for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could facilitate this robustness.},

  abstract = {Collective decision making involves on the one hand individual mental states such as beliefs, emotions and intentions, and on the other hand interaction with others with possibly different mental states. Achieving a satisfactory common group decision on which all agree requires that such mental states are adapted to each other by social interaction. Recent developments in social neuroscience have revealed neural mechanisms by which such mutual adaptation can be realised. These mechanisms not only enable intentions to converge to an emerging common decision, but at the same time enable to achieve shared underlying individual beliefs and emotions. This paper presents a computational model for such processes. As an application of the model, an agent-based analysis was made of patterns in crowd behaviour, in particular to simulate a real-life incident that took place on May 4, 2010 in Amsterdam. From available video material and witness reports, useful empirical data were extracted. Similar patterns were achieved in simulations, whereby some of the parameters of the model were tuned to the case addressed, and most parameters were assigned default values. The results show the inclusion of contagion of belief, emotion, and intention states of agents results in better reproduction of the incident than non-inclusion.},

We organize one large-scale pedestrian flow experiment on a ring corridor. With 278 participants, the density as high as 9 m^(-2) is reached. In the uni-directional flow, four different states are observed, including the free flow, congested state, over-congested state and hyper-congested state. The features of the hyper-congested state are similar to the "crowd turbulence" reported in the empirical data of Helbing et al., and the transition between the stopped state and the moving state can be found. The flow rates in the over-congested state are nearly constant, due to the downstream propagation of pedestrian clusters. In the bi-directional flow, three different types of lane formations are observed in the experiment: (1) three lanes are directly formed ; (2) two lanes are directly formed; (3) firstly three lanes are formed, and then they transit into two lanes. After the lane formation, some interesting phenomena have been observed, including the inhomogeneous distribution of pedestrians across the lanes, and the formation and dissipation of localized crowd. Our study is expected to help for better understanding and modeling the dynamics of high density pedestrian flow.},

The Koopman operator is an innite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a system's nonlinear dynamics through the linear evolution
of functions of the state space. Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a system's global nonlinear features. We demonstrate
how the presence of symmetries affects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we show that symmetry
considerations can also simplify finding the Koopman operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode decomposition
methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Specically, representation theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces
a block diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization. Practically, if the symmetries are known, the EDMD
and kernel DMD methods can be modified to give more ecient computation of the Koopman operator approximation and its eigenvalues,
eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes. Rounding out the development, we discuss the effect of measurement noise.},

Often train systems are investigated where seat choice may have a great impact on capacity utilization. Thus it is necessary to reproduce passengers' behavior inside trains. Yet there is surprisingly little research on the subject. In this contribution, we collect data on seating behavior in Munich's suburban trains, analyze it, and subsequently introduce a model that matches what we observe. For example, within a compartment, passengers tend to choose the seat group with the smallest number of other passengers. Within a seat group, passengers prefer window seats and forward-facing seats. When there is already another person, passengers tend to choose the seat diagonally across from that person. These and other aspects are incorporated in our model. We demonstrate the applicability of our model and present a qualitative validation with a simulation example. The model's implementation is part of the free and open-source VADERE simulation framework for pedestrian dynamics and thus available for cross-validation. The model can be used as one component in larger systems for the simulation of public transport.},

Yet the classicalcomputation  of  the  so-called  Sobol  indices  is  based  on  Monte  Carlo  simulation,  which  is  not  affordable when computationally expensive models are used, as it is the case in most applications in engineering and applied sciences.  In this respect metamodels such as polynomial chaos expansions(PCE) and Gaussian processes (GP) have received tremendous attention in the last few years, as they allow one to replace the original, taxing model by a surrogate which is built from an experimental design of limited size.  Then the surrogate can be used to compute the sensitivity indices in negligible time.  In this chapter an introduction to each technique is given, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in the context of global sensitivity analysis.  In particular, Sobol (resp.  total Sobol)indices can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients.  In contrast, confidence intervals onsensitivity indices can be derived straightforwardly from the properties of GPs.  The performance ofthe two techniques is finally compared on three well-known analytical benchmarks (Ishigami, G-Soboland Morris functions) as well as on a realistic engineering application (deflection of a truss structure).},

The Heat Method has a potential to be very fast, because its numerical solution cuts down to solving linear systems of equations, which can be parallelized. This work analyzes the suitability of the Heat Method for geodesic distance computation in pedestrian dynamics simulation. The thesis reveals several limitations of the Heat Method on 2D domains, which are of general interest. This is done by presenting numerical experiments using unstructured triangle meshes as spatial discretization. In the experiments linear numerical convergence is lost in the L2-Norm when the boundary is not smooth. It is also demonstrated that the method is sensitive to round-off errors. The latter finding is also true for closed 3D surfaces. The limitations of the Heat Method found in this study are not discussed in the original publication paper (2013). The findings of this work serve as additional information for users who consider using the Heat Method for geodesic distance computation instead of the Fast Marching Method.},

  abstract = {Formal models are commonly used in natural resource management (NRM) to study human-environment interactions and inform policy making. In the majority of applications, human behaviour is represented by the rational actor model despite growing empirical evidence of its shortcomings in NRM contexts. While the importance of accounting for the complexity of human behaviour is increasingly recognized, its integration into formal models remains a major challenge. The challenges are multiple: i) there exist many theories scattered across the social sciences, ii) most theories cover only a certain aspect of decision-making, iii) they vary in their degree of formalization, iv) causal mechanisms are often not specified. We provide a framework- MoHuB (Modelling Human Behavior) - to facilitate a broader inclusion of theories on human decision-making in formal NRM models. It serves as a tool and common language to describe, compare and communicate alternative theories. In doing so, we not only enhance understanding of commonalities and differences between theories, but take a first step towards tackling the challenges mentioned above. This approach may enable modellers to find and formalize relevant theories, and be more explicit and inclusive about theories of human decision making in the analysis of social-ecological systems.},

instance, can exceed the maximal rates observed in straight corridors. Consequently, accurate
predictions of pedestrians movements in complex buildings including corridors, corners,

the parameters. Artificial neural networks are robust algorithms able to identify various
types of patterns. In this paper, we will investigate their suitability for forecasting of pedestrian
dynamics in complex architectures. Therefore, we develop, train, and test several artificial
neural networks for predictions of pedestrian speeds in corridor and bottleneck
experiments. The estimations are compared with those of a classical speed-based model.
The results show that the neural networks can distinguish the two facilities and significantly
improve the prediction of pedestrian speeds.},

By comparing the experimental and the simulated trajectory in four directions, the evaluation of the model can be described by a radar chart, with which both qualitative and quantitative conclusions can be obtained. In order to demonstrate our method, we evaluate a social force model by 1,936 trajectories with graded densities in three different scenarios. Three qualitative conclusions are obtained by observing radar charts of the simulation of the unidirectional experiments. All of them are verified by the comparison of the macroscopic parameters. Besides, we find that a model with smaller error in our method always has a better performance at the macroscopic level. At last, the possible quantitative descriptions of the method are discussed. Compared to the evaluations by comparing collective features like fundamental diagram, our method is general, comprehensive and quantitative. The method provides a new possibility to evaluate any continuous pedestrian dynamic model in any scenario with a standard process.},

  abstract = {The sooty smoke generated from fire reduces visibility at fire scenes. This not only slows down evacuation, but also affects the mental states of evacuees. A series of evacuation experiments were conducted in a room under different visibility conditions. The crowd was formed by mixing individuals and social groups. Critical results regarding the evacuees travel time, pre-movement time, movement speed and typical behaviour, such as leadership behaviour and following behaviour, were collected. It was found that evacuation time increased, movement speed decreased and flow at exits became discontinuous when visibility was reduced. Group behaviour had a negative effect on evacuation in normal visibility, but the group effect was basically positive in the reduced visibility scenarios. A number of interesting findings were generated. Larger sized groups tend to move side by side, forming a horizontal structure. Smaller sized groups are more likely to form a vertical structure. Similarly, groups with a leader demonstrated vertical movement, distinct from the horizontal movement of groups without a leader. Following behaviour was more notably observed and is advantageous to overall evacuation when visibility reduced. The results of the pre-experiment questionnaire showed that over 80\% of the participants walk in groups on campus. The daily walking groups tended to maintain their moving forms even in the case of an emergency evacuation. Physical touch was more widely demonstrated in the emergency groups than in the daily groups. This study furthers the understanding of human behaviour in different visibility evacuation conditions and recognition of the impacts of social groups on crowd dynamics.},

  title    = {Modelling and Interpreting Pre-Evacuation Decision-Making Using Machine Learning},
  journal  = {Automation in Construction},
  year     = {2020},
  month    = {02},
  abstract = {The behaviour of building occupants in the rst stage of an evacuation can dramatically
impact the time required to evacuate buildings. This behaviour has been widely investigated
by scholars with a macroscopic approach tting random distributions to represent the
pre-evacuation time, i.e. time from noticing the rst cue until deliberate movement. However,
microscopic investigations on how building occupants respond to several social and
environmental factors are still rare in the literature.
This paper aims to leverage machine learning as a possible solution to investigate factors
aecting building occupants' decision-making during pre-evacuation stage. In particular, we
focus on applying interpretable machine learning to reveal the interactions among the input
variables and to capture nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the outcome.
As such, we use a well-established machine-learning algorithm|random forest|to
model and predict people's emergency behaviour pre-evacuation. We then apply tools to interpret
the black-box random forest model to extract useful knowledge and gain insights for
emergency planning. Specically, this algorithm is applied here to investigate the behaviour
of 569 building occupants split between ve unannounced evacuation drills in a cinema theatre.
The results indicate that both social and environmental factors aect the probability
of responding. Several independent variables, such as the time elapsed after the alarm has
started and the decision-maker's group size, are presenting strong nonlinear relationships
with the probability of switching to the response stage. Furthermore, we nd interactions
exist between the row number where the decision-maker sits and the number of responding
occupants visible to her; the complex relationship between the outcome and these two variables
can be visualized by using a two-dimensional partial dependence plot. An interesting
nding is that a decision-maker is more sensitive to the proportion of responding occupants
than the number of them; hence, the people sitting in the back are often responding more
slowly than the people in the front.},

  abstract = {The agent-based modeling approach is now used in many domains such as geography, ecology, or
economy, and more generally to study (spatially explicit) socio-environmental systems where the
heterogeneity of the actors and the numerous feedback loops between them requires amodular and
incremental approach to modeling. One major reason of this success, besides this conceptual
facility, can be found in the support provided by the development of increasingly powerful
software platforms, which now allow modelers without a strong background in computer science
to easily and quickly develop their own models. Another trend observed in the latest years is the
development of much more descriptive and detailed models able not only to better represent
complex systems, but also answer more intricate questions. In that respect, if all agent-based
modeling platforms support the design of small to mid-size models, i.e. models with little
heterogeneity between agents, simple representation of the environment, simple agent decisionmaking
processes, etc., very few are adapted to the design of large-scale models. GAMA is one of
the latter. It has been designed with the aim of supporting the writing (and composing) of fairly
complex models, with a strong support of the spatial dimension, while guaranteeing non-computer
scientists an easy access to high-level, otherwise complex, operations. This paper presents GAMA
1.8, the latest revision to date of the platform, with a focus on its modeling language and its
capabilities to manage the spatial dimension of models. The capabilities of GAMA are illustrated
by the presentation of applications that take advantage of its new features.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis provides information on the relative importance of model input parameters and assumptions. It is distinct from uncertainty analysis, which addresses the question "How uncertain is the prediction?" Uncertainty analysis needs to map what a model does when selected input assumptions and parameters are left free to vary over their range of existence, and this is equally true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, many uncertainty and sensitivity analyses still explore the input space moving along one-dimensional corridors leaving space of the input factors mostly unexplored. Our extensive systematic literature review shows that many highly cited papers (42% in the present analysis) fail the elementary requirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results, while discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and recognized good practices. We end by exploring possible reasons for this problem, and suggest some guidelines for proper use of the methods.},

  abstract = {Understanding influences on pedestrian movement is important to accurately
simulate crowd behaviour, yet little research has explored the psychological factors that
influence interactions between large groups in counterflow scenarios. Research from
social psychology has demonstrated that social identities can influence the micro-level
pedestrian movement of a psychological crowd, but this has not been extended to explore
behaviour when two large psychological groups are co-present. This study investigates
how the presence of large groups with different social identities can affect pedestrian
behaviour when walking in counterflow. Participants (N = 54) were divided into two
groups and primed to have identities as either team A or team B. The trajectories of
all participants were tracked to compare the movement of team A when walking alone to
when walking in counterflow with team B, based on their i) speed of movement and distance
walked, and ii) proximity between participants. In comparison to walking alone, the
presence of another group influenced team A to collectively self-organise to reduce their
speed and distance walked in order to walk closely together with ingroup members. We
discuss the importance of incorporating social identities into pedestrian group dynamics
for empirically validated simulations of counterflow scenarios.},

Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

  abstract  = {The timely and secure evacuation of an urban residential community is crucial to residents' safety when emergency events happen. This is different to evacuation of office spaces or schools, emergency evacuation in residential communities must consider the pre-evacuation time. The importance of estimating evacuation time components has been recognized for approximately 40 years. However, pre-evacuation time is rarely discussed in previous community-scale emergency evacuation studies. This paper proposes a new method that estimates the pre-evacuation time, which makes the evacuation simulation in urban residential communities more realistic. This method integrates the residents' pre-evacuation behavior data obtained by surveys to explore the influencing factors of pre-evacuation time and builds a predictive model to forecast pre-evacuation times based on the Random Forest algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to find the critical parameters in evacuation simulations. The results of evacuation simulations in different scenarios can be compared to identify potential evacuation problems. A case study in Luoshanqicun Community, Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The simulation results showed that the pre-evacuation times have significant impacts on the simulation procedure, including the total evacuation time, the congestion time and the congestion degree. This study can help to gain a deeper understanding of residents' behaviors under emergencies and improve emergency managements of urban communities.},

It turns to be unacceptable for high-dimensional model involving a large number of input variables (typically more than ten). Recently, Sobol and Kucherenko have proposed the derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSM), defined as the integral of the squared derivatives of the model output, showing that it can help to solve the problem of dimensionality in some cases. We provide a general inequality link between DGSM and total Sobol indices for input variables belonging to the class of Boltzmann probability measures, thus extending the previous results of Sobol and Kucherenko for uniform and normal measures. The special case of log-concave measures is also described. This link provides a DGSM-based maximal bound for the total Sobol indices. Numerical tests show the performance of the bound and its usefulness in practice.},

  abstract     = {To foster predictive simulations, a variety of methods have recently been developed to efficiently tackle uncertainty quantification (UQ) in complex, computational intensive problems. Many of these methods are non-intrusive and, thus, result in a (large) number of embarrassingly parallel black-box evaluations of the underlying simulation codes. While the focus of development is typically on the number of black-box evaluations, which represents the bulk of the computational workload, an additional level of potential performance gains exists. In many scenarios, uncertain input leads not only to uncertain outputs, but also to a varying and thus stochastic runtime of the simulation codes. For scheduling the individual black-box runs, this information is typically not taken into account, resulting in non-negligible idling times on parallel systems. In this contribution, we compare a variety of different scheduling strategies for non-intrusive UQ scenarios using the non-intrusive polynomial chaos approach. In particular, we propose to construct a surrogate model for the runtime of the application using the identical UQ methodology as for the original problem. Using this model to predict the runtimes for subsequent black-box runs allows for (heuristical) optimization of the scheduling. The method has been tested for the forward quantification of uncertainty on academic models and on a pedestrian simulation in the context of evacuation scenarios. This approach allows speed-up factors of about two for the total runtime and can be generalised to a large variety of applications that incorporate parameter-dependent runtime.},

  doi          = {10.1140/epjb/e2014-40699-x},
  abstract     = {Crowd simulation is rapidly becoming a standard tool for evacuation planning and evaluation. However, the many crowd models in the literature are structurally different, and few have been rigorously calibrated against real-world egress data, especially in emergency situations. In this paper we describe a procedure to quantitatively compare different crowd models or between models and real-world data. We simulated three models: (1) the lattice gas model, (2) the social force model, and (3) the RVO2 model, and obtained the distributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation time, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and (6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise matrix of statistical distances between the three models. Projecting the three models onto the first two principal components of the compromise matrix, we find the lattice gas and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the evacuation time, passage density, and flow rates, whereas the social force and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the total distance traveled. Most importantly, we find that the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from each other. Thus we propose to use this variable, if it can be measured, as the key test between different models, and also between models and the real world. Finally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency evacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force model agrees best with this real data.},

  abstract = {The choice of the exit to egress from a facility plays a fundamental role in pedestrian modelling and simulation. Yet, empirical evidence for backing up simulation is scarce. In this contribution, we present three new groups of experiments that we conducted in different geometries. We varied parameters such as the width of the doors, the initial location and number of pedestrians which in turn affected their perception of the environment. We extracted and analysed relevant indicators such as distance to the exits and density levels. The results put in evidence the fact that pedestrians use time-dependent information to optimize their exit choice, and that, in congested states, a load balancing over the exits occurs. We propose a minimal modelling approach that covers those situations, especially the cases where the geometry does not show a symmetrical configuration. Most of the models try to achieve the load balancing by simulating the system and solving optimization problems. We show statistically and by simulation that a linear model based on the distance to the exits and the density levels around the exit can be an efficient dynamical alternative.},

  abstract  = {Even bad code can function. But if code isnt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioners point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it.What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to tell the difference between good and bad codeHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good codeHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classesHow to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logicHow to unit test and practice test-driven developmentWhat smells and heuristics can help you identify bad codeThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

When these directions correspond to coordinate directions, one may apply global sensitivity measures to determine the most influential parameters. However, these methods perform poorly when the directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to first detect the directions of the strongest variability using evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional subspace---i.e., the active subspace---of the inputs. We develop a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100 Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

A single model setup of the same evacuation scenario may therefore produce a distribution of different occupant-evacuation time curves in the case of the use of a random sampling method. This creates an additional component of uncertainty caused by the impact of the number of simulated runs of the same scenario on evacuation model predictions, here named behavioural uncertainty. To date there is no universally accepted quantitative method to evaluate behavioural uncertainty and the selection of the number of runs is left to a qualitative judgement of the model user. A simple quantitative method using convergence criteria based on functional analysis is presented to address this issue. The method permits (1) the analysis of the variability of model predictions in relation to the number of runs of the same evacuation scenario, i.e. the study of behavioural uncertainty and (2) the identification of the optimal number of runs of the same scenario in relation to pre-defined acceptance criteria.},

whose exact values are often unknown. Prominent examples are the
number of pedestrians or their free-ow speeds. We carry out sensitivity
studies to analyze the system behaviour when crucial model parameters
are varied. We compute Sobol' indices using polynomial chaos expansion
to identify parameters with a strong impact on important evacuation
quantities such as the density in front of the bottleneck. A further di-
culty in this process arises from the fact that many simulation models,
including the one we use, are not strictly deterministic. In this paper,
we propose a pragmatic approach to deal with this stochasticity of the
simulation model.},

Today, studies are much more representative of the variety of crowd events and phenomena. The concern with understanding collective violence still remains a significant strand. Yet the emergence and development of the social identity approach has meant that the limiting assumptions of mindlessness that have hampered psychology in the past have given way to novel insights in the study of crowd conflict as well as in relation to numerous peaceful and less dramatic crowd events. This review of recent developments in research on the psychology of crowds and collective behaviour is divided into four areas. The first two sections cover the most well-established topics: crowd conflict and behaviour in mass emergencies. The second two sections cover topics where social psychology has only recently come together with other disciplines: pedestrian dynamics and mass gatherings. In each case, the social identity approach provides many of the concepts, research questions and hypotheses that have driven novel developments.},

Thus, gaze activity should be considered to better understand interactions between people in a crowd. In this work, we use Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate motion and gaze tracking, as well as to accurately control experimental conditions, in order to study the effect of crowd density on eye-gaze behavior. Our motivation is to better understand how interaction neighborhood (i.e., the subset of people actually influencing one's locomotion trajectory) changes with density. To this end, we designed two experiments. The first one evaluates the biases introduced by the use of VR on the visual activity when walking among people, by comparing eye-gaze activity while walking in a real and virtual street. We then designed a second experiment where participants walked in a virtual street with different levels of pedestrian density. We demonstrate that gaze fixations are performed at the same frequency despite increases in pedestrian density, while the eyes scan a narrower portion of the street. These results suggest that in such situations walkers focus more on people in front and closer to them. These results provide valuable insights regarding eye-gaze activity during interactions between people in a crowd, and suggest new recommendations in designing more realistic crowd simulations.},

  abstract = {In recent years numerous pedestrian simulation tools have been developed that can support crowd managers and government officials in their tasks. New technologies to monitor pedestrian flows are in dire need of models that allow for rapid state-estimation. Many contemporary pedestrian simulation tools model the movements of pedestrians at a microscopic level, which does not provide an exact solution. Macroscopic models capture the fundamental characteristics of the traffic state at a more aggregate level, and generally have a closed form solution which is necessary for rapid state estimation for traffic management purposes. This contribution presents a next step in the calibration and validation of the macroscopic continuum model detailed in Hoogendoorn et al. (2014).  The influence of global and local route choice on the development of crowd movement phenomena, such as dissipation, lane-formation and stripe-formation, is studied. This study shows that most self-organization phenomena and behavioural trends only develop under very specific conditions, and as such can only be simulated using specific parameter sets. Moreover, all crowd movement phenomena can be reproduced by means of the continuum model using one parameter set. This study concludes that the incorporation of local route choice behaviour and the balancing of the aptitude of pedestrians with respect to their own class and other classes are both essential in the correct prediction of crowd movement dynamics.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm named differential evolution with sensitivity analysis and the Powell's method (DESAP) for model calibration. The proposed DESAP owns three main features. First, an entropy-based sensitivity analysis operation is introduced to dynamically identify important parameters of the model as evolution progresses online. Second, the Powell's method is performed periodically to fine-tune the important parameters of the best individual in the population. Finally, in each generation, the evolutionary operators are performed on a small number of better individuals in the population. These new search mechanisms are integrated into the differential evolution framework to improve the search efficiency. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed DESAP is applied to two crowd model calibration cases. The results demonstrate that the proposed DESAP outperforms several model calibration methods in terms of solution accuracy and search efficiency.},

  abstract = {With the continuous growth of cities and the issues of insufficient space, indoor parking garages have become a vital component of transportation systems. Since emergencies will occur sooner or later, planning and organizing a successful evacuation plan for parking garages, with the aim of reducing the evacuation time and improving the driver's behavior during evacuations, is needed. This research presents a systematic approach for the development and evaluation of evacuation strategies in such environments, through state-of-the-art sensitivity analysis that provides faster convergence and lower computational burden. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a simulation model is developed using AIMSUN for a three-level indoor parking garage located in Athens, Greece. Four scenarios with different evacuation strategies and plans are considered. A multi-step sensitivity analysis framework is implemented to overcome the uncertainties that emerge from the model assumptions, model inaccuracy and shortage of data. Sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the consequences of the proposed scenarios and estimate the total time to evacuate the parking garage. The full experimental design resulted in the automated execution of more than 80 thousand simulations, corresponding to approximately 65 processor-days. The results of this research show that the developed methodology provides significant reduction in evacuation time (from 35% to over 40%). This process provides useful and credible ranges of expected evacuation times under all plausible outcomes.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a microscopic-discrete mathematical model describing crowd dynamics in no panic conditions. More specifically, pedestrians are set to move in order to reach a target destination and their movement is influenced by both behavioral strategies and physical forces. Behavioral strategies include individual desire to remain sufficiently far from structural elements (walls and obstacles) and from other walkers, while physical forces account for interpersonal collisions. The resulting pedestrian behavior emerges therefore from non-local, anisotropic and short/long-range interactions. Relevant improvements of our mathematical model with respect to similar microscopic-discrete approaches present in the literature are: (i) each pedestrian has his/her own dynamic gazing direction, which is regarded to as an independent degree of freedom and (ii) each walker is allowed to take dynamic strategic decisions according to his/her environmental awareness, which increases due to new information acquired on the surrounding space through their visual region. The resulting mathematical modeling environment is then applied to specific scenarios that, although simplified, resemble real-word situations. In particular, we focus on pedestrian flow in two-dimensional buildings with several structural elements (i.e., corridors, divisors and columns, and exit doors). The noticeable heterogeneity of possible applications demonstrates the potential of our mathematical model in addressing different engineering problems, allowing for optimization issues as well.},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted to the modeling of the pedestrian dynamics by means of the thermostatted kinetic theory. Specifically the microscopic interactions among pedestrians and an external force field are modeled for simulating the evacuation of pedestrians from a metro station. The fundamentals of the stochastic game theory and the thermostatted kinetic theory are coupled for the derivation of a specific mathematical model which depicts the time evolution of the distribution of pedestrians at different exits of a metro station. The perturbation theory is employed in order to establish the stability analysis of the nonequilibrium stationary states in the case of a metro station consisting of two exits. A general sensitivity analysis on the initial conditions, the magnitude of the external force field and the number of exits is presented by means of numerical simulations which, in particular, show how the asymptotic distribution and the convergence time are affected by the presence of an external force field. The results show how, in evacuation conditions, the interaction dynamics among pedestrians can be negligible with respect to the external force. The important role of the thermostat term in allowing the reaching of the nonequilibrium stationary state is stressed out. Research perspectives are underlined at the end of paper, in particular for what concerns the derivation of frameworks that take into account the definition of local external actions and the introduction of the space and velocity dynamics.},

The pedestrians are modeled as autonomous agents with non-linear system differential equations. The pedestrian agents may avoid other pedestrians, passing and overtaking slower pedestrians and to form a self-organization behavior of lane formations as in real pedestrian studies. A critical issue for such multi-agent pedestrian models, however, is the validation of the model against real world data. We show that the sensitivity analysis of control variables and parameters of the multi-agents model form the basis in ensuring the validation step. The model was automatically validated using real world data by minimizing the difference between the speed distributions. With the validated model, we can utilize model applications to evaluate pedestrian facilities.},

A large number of models have been proposed to simulate the movement characteristics of pedestrians. The collision-free speed model can qualitatively reproduce many self-organized phenomena well when there is no pushing and squeezing in the crowd. In addition, as a first-order model its computational efficiency is relatively high compared to force-based models. In this work, we validate the model quantitatively against empirical data from bottleneck experiments. The parameters controlling the desired speed and pedestrians' initial position distribution are adjusted to reproduce the empirical data. The Voronoi-method is used to calculate the density, speed and flow. It is shown that the model can reproduce the relation between the flow and the density when the initial density is less than 3.33 m-2. However, other characteristics in the simulation such as trajectories in the bottleneck and relation between flow and bottleneck width diverge to some extent from the experimental findings.},

This includes studies based on post-disaster analysis of real emergencies and past crowd incidents, field pedestrian observations in natural settings, and qualitative interviews with survivors of fire and other emergency incidents. The method of collecting field observations in natural settings is identified to be gaining increasing traction among other field methods (compared to the years preceding 2017) which in part reflects the recent growing attention to the calibration and validation of simulation models. Also, by assembling and analysing the entire body of empirical crowd literature from 1995 to 2019, this review identifies a list of controversial topics and puts a spotlight on recent experiments that have revisited and, in cases, challenged/modified certain long-held assumptions in crowd dynamics. Nine major controversial topics of crowd dynamics are identified for which mixed or contradictory empirical evidence exist. This includes questions related to the flow of pedestrians through bottlenecks (i.e. the faster-is-slower effect, partial obstruction effect, exit location effect, the nature of exit width-capacity relationship), as well as the decision-making aspects of pedestrian evacuations (i.e. the symmetry breaking phenomenon, and the effect of urgency level on various aspects of decision-making) and other topics such as the effect of social groups on evacuation efficiency or the effect of additional exits on blind evacuation efficiency. It is hoped that the discussions on these topics pave the way for further investigating and explaining these inconsistencies and settling the questions surrounding them.},

The performance of the method is tested using experimental data obtained in the near field of a zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jet. The better performance of HODMD is put in evidence making this technique suitable to both, cleaning the experimental noise using a limited number of snapshots and obtaining robust and sufficiently accurate results that elucidate the spatio-temporal structure of the flow. The results show that this ZNMF jet is temporally periodic in the near field, where the flow results from the interaction of a large number harmonics.

This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many systems of interest exhibit diverse behaviors across multiple time scales. We introduce a number of datadriven strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical systems and their embeddings from data. We consider two canonical cases: (i) systems for which we have full measurements of the governing variables and (ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full state measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) method can discover governing equations with relatively little data, provided that accurate measurements of the derivatives can be computed from the data. We introduce a sampling method that allows SINDy to scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales; specifically, we can discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with incomplete observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, based on time-delay embedding coordinates, can be used to obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system that nearly perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems on the attractor. We introduce two strategies for using HAVOK on systems with multiple time scales. Together, our approaches provide a suite of mathematical strategies for reducing the data required to discover and model nonlinear multiscale systems.},

This framework is based on a representation of the Koopman and Perron{\textendash}Frobenius groups of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of the dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion maps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions through a regularized advection{\textendash}diffusion operator, and employ these eigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high smoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point spectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group into mutually commuting vector fields that transform naturally under changes of observation modality, which we reconstruct in data space through a representation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We also establish a correspondence between Koopman operators and Laplace{\textendash}Beltrami operators constructed from data in Takens delaycoordinate space, and use this correspondence to provide an interpretation of diffusion-mapped delay coordinates for this class of systems. Moreover, we take advantage of a special property of the Koopman eigenfunction basis, namely that the basis elements evolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models for probability densities and observables. In systems with more complex spectral behavior, including mixing systems, we develop a method inspired from time change in dynamical systems to transform the generator to a new operator with potentially improved spectral properties, and use that operator for vector field decomposition and nonparametric forecasting.},

  abstract  = {The diffusion maps together with the geometric harmonics provide a method for describing the geometry of high dimensional data and for extending these descriptions to new data points and to functions, which are defined on the data. This method suffers from two limitations. First, even though real-life data is often heterogeneous , the assumption in diffusion maps is that the attributes of the processed dataset are comparable. Second, application of the geometric harmonics requires careful setting for the correct extension scale and condition number. In this paper, we propose a method for representing and learning heterogeneous datasets by using diffusion maps for unifying and embedding heterogeneous dataset and by replacing the geometric harmonics with the Laplacian pyramid extension. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate how the learning process becomes straightforward when the constructed representation smoothly parameterizes the task-related function.},

We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},

  abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

  abstract  = {The accuracy and the computational efficiency of a Point-Collocation Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos (NIPC) method applied to stochastic problems with multiple uncertain input variables has been investigated. Two stochastic model problems with multiple uniform random variables were studied to determine the effect of different sampling methods (Random, Latin Hypercube, and Hammersley) for the selection of the collocation points. The effect of the number of collocation points on the accuracy of polynomial chaos expansions were also investigated. The results of the stochastic model problems show that all three sampling methods exhibit a similar performance in terms of the the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the chaos expansions. It has been observed that using a number of collocation points that is twice more than the minimum number required gives a better approximation to the statistics at each polynomial degree. This improvement can be related to the increase of the accuracy of the polynomial coefficients due to the use of more information in their calculation. The results of the stochastic model problems also indicate that for problems with multiple random variables, improving the accuracy of polynomial chaos coefficients in NIPC approaches may reduce the computational expense by achieving the same accuracy level with a lower order polynomial expansion. To demonstrate the application of Point-Collocation NIPC to an aerospace problem with multiple uncertain input variables, a stochastic computational aerodynamics problem which includes the numerical simulation of steady, inviscid, transonic flow over a three-dimensional wing with an uncertain free-stream Mach number and angle of attack has been studied. For this study, a 5th degree Point-Collocation NIPC expansion obtained with Hammersley sampling was capable of estimating the statistics at an accuracy level of 1000 Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo simulations with a significantly lower computational cost.},

This is accomplished by utilizing the large amount of literature in the classical approximation theory. Here we survey the major approaches in SC. In particular, we focus on a few well-established approaches: interpolation, regression, and pseudo projection. We present the basic formulations of these approaches and some of their major variations. Representative examples are also provided to illustrate their major properties.},

Simulated agents avoid collisions through mechanisms that belong to each individual, such as being repelled from each other by imaginary forces. But classic locomotion models fail when collective cooperation is called for, notably when an agent, say a first-aid attendant, needs to forge a path through a densely packed group. We present a controlled experiment to observe what happens when humans pass through a dense static crowd. We formulate and test hypothesis on salient phenomena. We discuss our observations in a psychological framework. We derive a model that incorporates: agents' perception and cognitive processing of a situation that needs cooperation; selection from a portfolio of behaviours, such as being cooperative; and a suitable action, such as swapping places. Agents' ability to successfully get through a dense crowd emerges as an effect of the psychological model.},

Generally results show superior performance of the Quasi Monte Carlo approach based on Sobol sequences in line with theoretical predictions. Latin Hypercube Sampling can be more efficient than both Monte Carlo method and Quasi Monte Carlo method but the latter inequality holds for a reduced set of function typology and at small number of sampled points. In conclusion Quasi Monte Carlo method would appear the safest bet when integrating functions of unknown typology.},

In this paper we give an explicit estimate of the error introduced, which is based on a discrete comparison principle. This estimate implies, in particular, that the choice of an accuracy level that is independent of the speed function F results in the complexity bound being O(Fmax/Fmin N). A numerical experiment illustrates this robustness problem for large ratios Fmax/Fmin.},

One weakness of this type of models, is the size of the cells which is mostly considered to be of the size of a pedestrian (i.e. 40cm*40cm or near to it). Each pedestrian stands in a single cell and during simulation time steps, transits to neighbouring cells. The size of the cells dictates discrete speed steps for pedestrians and chess like movements. A pedestrian could move one or more cells in a simulation time step or do not move at all. In order to have more smooth movement and different speeds for pedestrians (i.e. from different ages, physical and health status) we propose a finer grid cellular automata. We use this model to build a least effort cellular automata movement algorithm. The algorithm has been used in small scale movement layer of our multi-agent crowd simulation platform in order to allow more realistic simulations of crowd flows. A simple walkway scenario has been used to test the outcome of the model. Results of the simulation are reported in this paper.},

In this article, we examine the movement characteristics of Palestinian pedestrians using the fundamental diagram for single-file movement experiments conducted with an emphasis on gender compositions. Our findings show that the mean velocity of exclusively male pedestrians is approximately the same as exclusively female pedestrians. 
For instance, when the number of pedestrians is 20, the velocities for male and female are 0.72 +- 0.10 ms -1 and 0.71 +- 0.11 ms -1 , respectively, whereas their velocity decreases gradually if they walk in mixed groups with an average velocity of 0.61 +- 0.11 ms -1 . 
We also compare our findings with other culture-based experiments to demonstrate that pedestrian cultures have an effect on their movement characteristics. Moreover, we demonstrate that age is another factor that affects pedestrians' movement. A comparative analysis is performed between Palestinian and Chinese experiments for this purpose. Our results confirm that for relatively high densities older Chinese pedestrians walk faster than young Palestinians in groups of mixed gender.},

Pedestrians' complex behaviors characterized by the self-organization phenomena and movement data characterized by the fundamental diagram are then studied after the data collections, which can be used to calibrate and validate the pedestrian models. The mathematical models for pedestrian dynamics from both tactical level and operational level are also highlighted. The simulation data produced by the mathematical models could further reproduce pedestrian behaviors during the observations and contribute to decision makings for improving the evacuation efficiency. The applications of pedestrian models for behavior analysis, evacuation simulation, and layout design are also presented.

To test the feasibility of this model, we applied it to a typical scenario in which pedestrians evacuate from a square room with single exit and conducted parameter sensitivity study on the length of the time step ??. The simulation results show that, within a valid range, changing ?? only has minor influence on the evacuation process. We can directly identify area with high density as bottleneck from dynamically changed density map even the relatively large time step is adopted. In addition, the commercial package AnyLogic was used to benchmark the performance of this model. The results show that the mesoscopic model discerns evacuation patterns in more details compared to the macroscopic models and with higher efficiently computational speed than the microscopic models.},

  abstract     = {Organizers of large events have to ensure efficient mobility to guarantee a smooth and secure event course. Traffic and crowd simulations help to predict weak spots on the event's infrastructure. Thus, we propose a hybrid and multiscale approach to provide realistic and computationally efficient simulations. Our approach is able to predict traffic and crowd flow on different spatial resolutions. Events can be modeled on three spatial scales: macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic. Each scale has individual characteristics according to spatial resolution and computational efficiency. Our approach combines these scales to model multimodal aspects of mobilityduring an event course. For the macroscopic scale, a public transport approach, which combines network based optimization with simulation techniques, is presented. This optimization approach for bus transport was integrated into a crowd simulation platform, which simulates the behavior of visitors after having arrived at the event site.},

  abstract   = {Microscopic crowd simulation can help to enhance the safety of pedestrians in situations that range from museum visits to music festivals. To obtain a useful prediction, the input parameters must be chosen carefully. In many cases, a lack of knowledge or limited measurement accuracy add uncertainty to the input. In addition, for meaningful parameter studies, we first need to identify the most influential parameters of our parametric computer models. The field of uncertainty quantification offers standardized and fully automatized methods that we believe to be beneficial for pedestrian dynamics. In addition, many methods come at a comparatively low cost, even for computationally expensive problems. This allows for their application to larger scenarios. We aim to identify and adapt fitting methods to microscopic crowd simulation in order to explore their potential in pedestrian dynamics. In this work, we first perform a variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices and then crosscheck the results by a derivative-based measure, the activity scores. We apply both methods to a typical scenario in crowd simulation, a bottleneck. Because constrictions can lead to high crowd densities and delays in evacuations, several experiments and simulation studies have been conducted for this setting. We show qualitative agreement between the results of both methods. Additionally, we identify a one-dimensional subspace in the input parameter space and discuss its impact on the simulation. Moreover, we analyze and interpret the sensitivity indices with respect to the bottleneck scenario.},

  abstract    = {This thesis describes the developement of a new type of simulation tool for the assessment of designs of public transport facilities (stations, airports) and other public spaces with intensive pedestrian flows. Since the available space for such facilities is increasingly under pressure, the space efficiency and walking comfort is becoming more and more important. The developed simulation tool provides designers and decision-makers with all kinds of quantitative information about the expected quality of pedestrian (traffic) flows such as travel times, waiting times, queue building, preferred routes, visits to shops and counters, etc. This information is very useful in comparing multiple designs as well as to optimise a specific design. The simulation model also is meant to improve schedules of public transport services at interchange nodes by minimising passenger transfer times. To that end, special attention is paid to the modelling of boarding and alighting processes. New insights about walking have been gained by performing unique large-scale laboratory experiments in which large groups of subjects were assigned various walking tasks, such as high volume crossing flows and walking through bottlenecks until flow breaks down. Specific walking and route choice models are developed using observations of passengers on platforms (such as in Delft) and route choice through the station (such as in Delft and Breda). The tool has proven its value in the analysis of new designs of the future Rotterdam Central Station and performance tests of the new Breskens-Vlissingen ferry terminals.},

The paper shows how observations of density, speed, and flow that have been collected from laboratory walking experiments can be interpreted from the viewpoint of first-order theory. It is observed that pedestrians present at the same cross section inside of the congested region may encounter different flow conditions. This mainly depends on the lateral position of the pedestrian with respect to the center of the congested region. In the lateral center, high densities and low speeds are observed. However, on the boundary of the congested region, pedestrians may walk in nearly free-flow conditions and literally walk around this congested region. Visualization of these data in the flow-density plane results in a large scatter of points that have similar flows (bottleneck capacity) but different densities. This can be explained by noticing that observations of congestion of pedestrian traffic over the total width of the cross section do not belong to a single fundamental diagram but belong to a set of different fundamental diagrams. This observation has consequences for estimation of the fundamental diagram describing pedestrian traffic.},

The models are oriented to specific real world applications: a one-dimensional model of crowd-structure interaction in footbridges and a two-dimensional model of pedestrian flow in an underground station with several obstacles and exits. The noticeable heterogeneity of the applications demonstrates the significance of the physical framework and its versatility in addressing different engineering problems.

  abstract     = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (\S2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (\S\S2, 3). The theory is applied (\S4) to the problem of estimating how a ``hump'', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a ``shock wave'') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (\S5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (\S6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

  abstract     = {We use a simple traffic micro-simulation model based on queueing dynamics as introduced by Gawron [IJMPC, 9(3):393, 1998] in order to simulate traffic in Portland/Oregon. Links have a flow capacity, that is, they do not release more vehicles per second than is possible according to their capacity. This leads to queue built-up if demand exceeds capacity. Links also have a storage capacity, which means that once a link is full, vehicles that want to enter the link need to wait. This leads to queue spill-back through the network. The model is compatible with route-plan-based approaches such as TRANSIMS, where each vehicle attempts to follow its pre-computed path. Yet, both the data requirements and the computational requirements are considerably lower than for the full TRANSIMS microsimulation. Indeed, the model uses standard emme/2 network data, and runs about eight times faster than real time with more than 100 000 vehicles simultaneously in the simulation on a single Pentium-type CPU. We derive the model's fundamental diagrams and explain it. The simulation is used to simulate traffic on the emme/2 network of the Portland (Oregon) metropolitan region (20 000 links). Demand is generated by a simplified home-to-work destination assignment which generates about half a million trips for the morning peak. Route assignment is done by iterative feedback between micro-simulation and router. An iterative solution of the route assignment for the above problem can be achieved within about half a day of computing time on a desktop workstation. We compare results with field data and with results of traditional assignment runs by the Portland Metropolitan Planning Organization. Thus, with a model such as this one, it is possible to use a dynamic, activities-based approach to transportation simulation (such as in TRANSIMS) with affordable data and hardware. This should enable systematic research about the coupling of demand generation, route assignment, and micro-simulation output.},

In our model, there are two kinds of particles, which are right-going particles and left-going particles. They often face opponent particles, so that they swerve to the right or left stochastically in order to avoid conflicts. The particles reinforce their preferences of the swerving direction after their successful avoidance. The preference is also weakened by memory-loss effect. Result of our simulation indicates that cooperative avoiding behavior is achieved, i.e., swerving directions of the particles are unified, when the density of particles is close to 1/2 and the memory-loss rate is small. Furthermore, when the right-going particles occupy the majority of the system, we observe that their flow increases when the number of left-going particles, which prevent the smooth movement of right-going particles, becomes large. It is also investigated that the critical memory-loss rate of the cooperative avoiding behavior strongly depends on the size of the system. Small system can prolong the cooperative avoiding behavior in wider range of memory-loss rate than large system.},

  abstract     = {The floor field cellular automaton model (FFCA) has been widely adopted to simulate pedestrian and evacuation dynamics. Many self-organized phenomena could be reproduced with the FFCA model, such as the lane formation in bidirectional pedestrian flow. However, as presented in this study, when we tried to use the FFCA model to simulate an experiment on bidirectional pedestrian flows performed in discrete space and time, we found the model failed to agree with the empirical results. The gridlock formation (not observed in the experiment) was unavoidable in the FFCA model and the clearance time in simulation was much larger than that of the experiment. From the experiments, we observed that people would like to stop if they would foresee a benefit in the near feature and consequently give way to people coming from the opposite direction. This inspired us to incorporate such behavioral rules for modeling pedestrian movements in bidirectional flows. To this end, we introduced a waiting time rule to the original FFCA model. Results showed the performance of the model could be significantly improved. The gridlock probability could be reduced to zero, with clearance time agreeing well with the experimental outcome. Findings from this study can provide meaningful insights for researchers into understanding the pedestrian behavior in bidirectional flow and help develop more reliable simulation software.},

  abstract     = {20Cellular automaton (CA) approach has been widely used in pedestrian flow studies. However, one problem of CA approach is that gridlock usually occurs in counter flow. One possible reason is that CA models still do not represent correctly cognitive processes of real people. To study whether the gridlock would occur when real people were required to walk in discrete space and time, we performed an experimental study on pedestrian counter flow. Remarkable collaboration behaviours of pedestrians have been observed, which enable the formation of exit rows and prevent the formation of gridlock. Furthermore, we performed a comparative experiment in which pedestrians walked under normal condition. Our studies indicate that to fully describe pedestrian counter flow with CA approach, the remarkable collaboration behaviours of pedestrians need to be considered. Moreover, one might also need to consider other factors such as flexible characteristics of pedestrians, small cell size, and various walk speeds.},

Governments around the world have adopted different measures to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, ranging from strict lockdowns prohibiting building access to recommendations on physical distancing (also called social distancing). As countries around the world gradually re-open and restrictions are removed, building safety should be assessed in light of multiple threats, including virus transmission and fire. This paper analyzes the use of evacuation models in times of pandemic by discussing:
 1. Development of new outputs for the analysis of occupant exposure

  abstract     = {In many virtual environment applications, paths have to be planned for characters to traverse from a start to a goal position in the virtual world while avoiding obstacles. Contemporary applications require a path planner that is fast (to ensure real-time interaction with the environment) and flexible (to avoid local hazards such as small and dynamic obstacles). In addition, paths need to be smooth and short to ensure natural looking motions. Current path planning techniques do not obey these criteria simultaneously. For example, A* approaches generate unnatural looking paths, potential field-based methods are too slow, and sampling-based path planning techniques are inflexible. We propose a new technique, the Corridor Map Method (CMM), which satisfies all the criteria. In an off-line construction phase, the CMM creates a system of collision-free corridors for the static obstacles in an environment. In the query phase, paths can be planned inside the corridors for different types of characters while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Experiments show that high-quality paths for single characters or groups of characters can be obtained in real-time.},

A total of 96 singles and 194 pedestrian groups with different sizes were adopted as test subjects. Their stepping features such as speed, step length, step time and step width were obtained according to trajectory extraction and curvature calculation. Relations between these variables during ascending and descending movement on stairs are analyzed and compared. The effects of group sizes and movement processes on stepping locomotion are also discussed. It is discovered that both step time and step width for groups with larger size are significantly higher during descending movement. This study provides a new insight into stepping behavior of pedestrian groups on stairs, and is beneficial to group movement modelling and pedestrian facility design.},

A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. Focusing on the COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can quantify the effect of interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.},

  abstract = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a "new normal". Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: "in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?", "Are there repeated offenders?", and "How are new crowd management measures performing?". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging.
In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

In this paper, we propose a new cognitive agent architecture based on the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) paradigm integrated into the GAMA modeling platform and its GAML modeling language. This architecture was designed to be simple-to-use for modelers, flexible enough to manage complex behaviors, and with low computational cost. An experiment carried out with different profiles of end-users shows that the architecture is actually usable even by modelers who have little knowledge in programming and in Artificial Intelligence.},

The IMPACT model was validated against data from an evacuation drill using the existing EXODUS evacuation model. Results show that on all measures, the IMPACT model is within or close to the prescribed boundaries, thereby establishing its validity. Structured simulations with the validated model revealed important findings, including: the effect of doors as bottlenecks, social contagion speeding up evacuation time, falling behaviour not affecting evacuation time significantly, and travelling in groups being more beneficial for evacuation time than travelling alone. This research has important practical applications for crowd management professionals, including transport hub operators, first responders, and risk assessors.},

Agents joining a society or accepting a contract for the purpose of executing specific collaborative tasks usually have to adopt norms representing certain rules and regulations. Adoption of norms can cause problems -- an agent maybe already hold norms that would be in conflict or inconsistent with new norms it adopts. How can it be shown that the set of norms is consistent to allow the agent to act according to the ideals that the norms specify? In general, the answer to such a question in a real-world situation is not simple. This paper addresses the problem of finding a pragmatic solution to the problem of norm consistency checking for practical reasoning agents in the context of the NoA Normative Agent Architecture.},

emergency evacuation situations. For instance, during the 2005 London
bombings, it was reported that evacuees helped injured persons to escape

such helping behavior provides a collective good while it is a costly behavior
because the volunteers spend extra time to assist the injured persons
in case of emergency evacuations. In order to study the collective effects
of helping behavior in emergency evacuations, we have performed numerical
simulations of helping behavior among evacuees in a room evacuation
scenario. Our simulation model is based on the volunteer's dilemma game
reflecting volunteering cost. The game theoretic model is coupled with
a social force model to understand the relationship between the spatial
and social dynamics of evacuation scenarios. By systematically changing
the cost parameter of helping behavior, we observed different patterns of
collective helping behaviors and these collective patterns are summarized
with a phase diagram.},

Different from existing models of mostly high-level skill learning that use a top-down approach (that is, turning declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge through practice), we adopt a bottom-up approach toward low-level skill learning, where procedural knowledge develops first and declarative knowledge develops later. Our model is formed by integrating connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods to perform on-line reactive learning. It adopts a two-level dual-representation framework (Sun, 1995), with a combination of localist and distributed representation. We compare the model with human data in a minefield navigation task, demonstrating some match between the model and human data in several respects.},

outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform

information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people.
Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease
transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant
exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a
pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather
than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant
exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by
retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types
of disease transmissions. This work allows policy makers to perform informed decisions concerning building
usage during a pandemic.},

  abstract    = {Different observations of a relation between inputs ("sources") and outputs ("targets") are often reported in terms of histograms (discretizations of the source and the target densities). Transporting these densities to each other provides insight regarding the underlying relation. In (forward) uncertainty quantification, one typically studies how the distribution of inputs to a system affects the distribution of the system responses. Here, we focus on the identification of the system (the transport map) itself, once the input and output distributions are determined, and suggest a modification of current practice by including data from what we call "an observation process". We hypothesize that there exists a smooth manifold underlying the relation; the sources and the targets are then partial observations (possibly projections) of this manifold. Knowledge of such a manifold implies knowledge of the relation, and thus of "the right" transport between source and target observations. When the source-target observations are not bijective (when the manifold is not the graph of a function over both observation spaces, either because folds over them give rise to density singularities, or because it marginalizes over several observables), recovery of the manifold is obscured. Using ideas from attractor reconstruction in dynamical systems, we demonstrate how additional information in the form of short histories of an observation process can help us recover the underlying manifold. The types of additional information employed and the relation to optimal transport based solely on density observations is illustrated and discussed, along with limitations in the recovery of the true underlying relation.},

  abstract = {An effective evacuation of buildings is critical to minimize casualties due to natural or anthropogenic hazards. Building evacuation models help in preparing for future events and shed light on possible shortcomings of current evacuation designs. However, such models are seldom compared or validated with real evacuations, which is a critical step in assessing their predictive capacities. This research focuses on the evacuation of a K-12 (kindergarten to 12th grade) school located within the tsunami inundation zone of Iquique, Chile. An agent-based evacuation model was developed to simulate the evacuation of approximately 1500 children and staff from the school during a global evacuation drill carried out for the entire city. The model simulates the motions of heterogeneous human agents, and the simulations were validated using video analysis of the real event. Resulting error estimations between predicted versus measured flow rates and evacuation times are 13.5\% and 5.9\%, respectively. The good agreement between the simulated and measured values can be attributed to the known distribution of students and staff at the start of the drill, and their known exposure to emergency preparedness protocols. However, the results presented herein show that this mathematical evacuation model can be used for logistical changes in the emergency planning.},

Probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods have been used to propagate uncertainty from model inputs to outputs when input uncertainties are large and have been characterized probabilistically. Polynomial chaos (PC) methods have found increased use in probabilistic UQ over the past decade. This review describes the use of PC expansions for the representation of random variables/fields and discusses their utility for the propagation of uncertainty in computational models, focusing on CFD models. Many CFD applications are considered, including flow in porous media, incompressible and compressible flows, and thermofluid and reacting flows. The review examines each application area, focusing on the demonstrated use of PC UQ and the associated challenges. Cross-cutting challenges with time unsteadiness and long time horizons are also discussed.},

Accuracy concerns the closeness of the fit between a simulation and observed data, and believability concerns the human perception of plausibility. In this paper, we address both issues via a so-called `Turing test' for crowds, using movies generated from both accurate simulations and observations of real crowds. The fundamental question we ask is `Can human observers distinguish between real and simulated crowds' In two studies with student volunteers (n = 384 and n = 156), we find that non-specialist individuals are able to reliably distinguish between real and simulated crowds when they are presented side-by-side, but they are unable to accurately classify them. Classification performance improves slightly when crowds are presented individually, but not enough to out-perform random guessing. We find that untrained individuals have an idealized view of human crowd behaviour which is inconsistent with observations of real crowds. Our results suggest a possible framework for establishing a minimal set of collective behaviours that should be integrated into the next generation of crowd simulation models.},

  abstract = {We provide research findings on the physics of aerosol and droplet dispersion relevant to the hypothesized aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d<=20 mycro m) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100 mycro m), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d<=20 mycro m) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, "exposure time" to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional "safety distance" thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.},

      history of psychology. For nearly a half century it has been understood to show that 
      assigning people to a toxic role will, on its own, unlock the human capacity to 
      treat others with cruelty. In contrast, principles of identity leadership argue that 
      roles are unlikely to elicit cruelty unless leaders encourage potential perpetrators 
      to identify with what is presented as a noble ingroup cause and to believe their 
      actions are necessary for the advancement of that cause. Although identity 
      leadership has been implicated in behavior ranging from electoral success to 
      obedience to authority, researchers have hitherto had limited capacity to establish 
      whether role conformity or identity leadership provides a better account of the 
      cruelty observed in the SPE. Through examination of material in the SPE archive, we 
      present comprehensive evidence that, rather than guards conforming to role of their 
      own accord, experimenters directly encouraged them to adopt roles and act tough in a 
      manner consistent with tenets of identity leadership. Implications for the analysis 
      of conformity and cruelty as well as for interpretation of the SPE are discussed.},

It has been criticized on many grounds, and yet a majority of textbook authors have ignored these criticisms in their discussions of the SPE, thereby misleading both students and the general public about the study's questionable scientific validity. Data collected from a thorough investigation of the SPE archives and interviews with 15 of the participants in the experiment further question the study's scientific merit. These data are not only supportive of previous criticisms of the SPE, such as the presence of demand characteristics, but provide new criticisms of the SPE based on heretofore unknown information. These new criticisms include the biased and incomplete collection of data, the extent to which the SPE drew on a prison experiment devised and conducted by students in one of Zimbardo's classes 3 months earlier, the fact that the guards received precise instructions regarding the treatment of the prisoners, the fact that the guards were not told they were subjects, and the fact that participants were almost never completely immersed by the situation. Possible explanations of the inaccurate textbook portrayal and general misperception of the SPE's scientific validity over the past 5 decades, in spite of its flaws and shortcomings, are discussed.},

  abstract    = {Microscopic crowd simulation, for example performed with the optimal steps model, can support the planning process of mass events
if the model parameters are chosen correctly. The exact values of these parameters are often unknown, so the input suffers from uncertainties that can affect the output. To assure that the right conclusions are drawn from a simulation, modellers can employ forward uncertainty quantification methods.
However, applying such methods to the optimal steps model is rather uncommon. Therefore, this thesis addresses the question which approach is suitable for estimating the uncertainty and sensitivity of the model output. It focuses on polynomial chaos expansions, which allow to derive statistical moments and Sobol' sensitivity indices for uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, respectively. The polynomial chaos expansion combined with the point collocation method and the pseudo-spectral approach is applied to a corridor scenario and the results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations.
Thus, it can be shown that the point collocation method is efficient because it yields accurate results while the computational effort is low. Based on that, the method is transferred to a large scale scenario,a parade through a city center. The outcomes are interpreted to demonstrate that they are relevant to reality.},

Here I direct attention to a process which would overcome this basic problem, and which also seems to provide an explanation of all the main features of published data. It is a mechanism in principle only, however, and is discussed here in no more detail than is necessary to clarify the basic ideas and to provide a basis for further investigation.},

Following the exposure treatment, Ss were mildly frustrated and tested for the amount of imitative and  nonimitative aggression in a  different experimental setting. The overall results provide evidence for both the facilitating  and the modeling influence of film-mediated aggressive stimulation.

The book puts forward a new theory that seems to reconcile these data and assumptions. This new theory can account for data with which other theories have difficulty: it integrates empirical phenomena that have been regarded as unrelated, and it is supported by the results of experiments designed specifically to test its implications.

Results of 60 independent studies showed little support for (a) the occurrence of deindividuated (antinormative) behaviors or (b) the existence of a deindividuated state. Research results were explained more adequately by situation-specific than by general social norms. Analyses indicated that groups and individuals conform more to situation-specific norms when they are "deindividuated." These findings are inconsistent with deindividuation theory but support a social identity model of deindividuation effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Most experiments in social psychology are considered defective because the investigators, lacking social perspective, set up their problems within the culture of their own communities. The writer has no sympathy for the controversy between the individual and the social approaches. The individual is regarded as basic, and any valid psychological principle should apply to the individual, alone, in a group, or in relation to his whole culture. Throughout psychology, in perception, in judgment, in affectivity, etc., the frame of reference is shown to be an important determinant of experience. Variations in culture are shown to be variations in frames of reference common to various groups. Social frames of reference (social norms, i.e. values, customs, stereotypes, conventions, etc.) are regarded first as stimuli which meet the individual in his associations with others and then become interiorized. The process of establishing a social norm is illustrated experimentally in an unstable perceptual situation (autokinetic phenomenon). Observing alone, the individual establishes his own frame of reference, which is modified in the direction of conformity when he observes in a group. Observing first in a group, frames of reference are set up which determine subsequent reports when the individual observes alone (illustrating the factual basis for the contentions that supra-individual qualities arise in group situations). Social values in relation to personal needs are discussed in the light of this experiment. A final chapter describes "human nature" as dependent upon the norms peculiar to the individual's group.},

  abstract = {Crowd simulation has emerged in the last decade as a widely used method of visual effects, computer games, and urban planning, etc. The improvement of hardware performance and the urgent need of special effect lead to an unprecedented wave of crowd simulation studies. This paper reports a review of crowd simulation models from traditional methods to recent methods (e.g. group simulation, emotion contagion). Traditional models can simulate general crowd dynamics which have the advantages of both microscopic and macroscopic models. The recent studies of crowd simulation from group simulation to social psychology crowds are possible to simulate realistic crowds. The purpose of this review is to introduce commonly used crowd simulation methods for newcomers to this field by making a systematic literature review, discussions and analysis of different models. The results reveal the traditional models can simulate most of the normal crowds, but lack expressiveness for special groups which needs to be solved urgently in the current applications, particularly on visual effects and urban planning. Group simulation and emotion contagion could improve the simulation realism, but it also needs to be improved in computation cost and model optimization. Also, future research directions are suggested aiming to develop new applications focused on more realistic, natural and efficient crowd simulation.},

  abstract  = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

  abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown.

The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared.

ABC is becoming the go-to option when the data and/or parameter dimension is large because it relies on user-chosen summary statistics rather than the full data and is therefore computationally feasible. One technical challenge with ABC is that the quality of the approximation to the posterior distribution of model parameters depends on the user-chosen summary statistics. In this paper, the user requirement to choose effective summary statistics in order to accurately estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters is investigated and illustrated by example, using a model and corresponding real data of mitochondrial DNA population dynamics. We show that for some choices of summary statistics, the posterior distribution of model parameters is closely approximated and for other choices of summary statistics, the posterior distribution is not closely approximated. A strategy to choose effective summary statistics is suggested in cases where the stochastic computer model can be run at many trial parameter settings, as in the example.},

However, due to their complexity, such models are difficult to calibrate and evaluate. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) offers an increasingly popular approach to this problem, widely applied across a variety of fields. However, ensuring the accuracy of ABC's estimates has been difficult. Here, we obtain more accurate estimates by incorporating estimation of error into the ABC protocol. We show how this can be done where the data consist of repeated measures of the same quantity and errors may be assumed to be normally distributed and independent. We then derive the correct acceptance probabilities for a probabilistic ABC algorithm, and update the coverage test with which accuracy is assessed. We apply this method, which we call error-calibrated ABC, to a toy example and a realistic 14-parameter simulation model of earthworms that is used in environmental risk assessment. A comparison with exact methods and the diagnostic coverage test show that our approach improves estimation of parameter values and their credible intervals for both models.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have seen enormous improvements in computational inference for statistical models; there have been competitive continual enhancements in a wide range of computational tools. In Bayesian inference, first and foremost, MCMC techniques have continued to evolve, moving from random walk proposals to Langevin drift, to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and so on, with both theoretical and algorithmic innovations opening new opportunities to practitioners. However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects. Approximate models and algorithms may thus be at the core of the next computational revolution.},

  abstract = {For nearly any challenging scientific problem evaluation of the likelihood is problematic if not impossible. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) allows us to employ the whole Bayesian formalism to problems where we can use simulations from a model, but cannot evaluate the likelihood directly. When summary statistics of real and simulated data are compared--rather than the data directly--information is lost, unless the summary statistics are sufficient. Sufficient statistics are, however, not common but without them statistical inference in ABC inferences are to be considered with caution. Previously other authors have attempted to combine different statistics in order to construct (approximately) sufficient statistics using search and information heuristics. Here we employ an information-theoretical framework that can be used to construct appropriate (approximately sufficient) statistics by combining different statistics until the loss of information is minimized. We start from a potentially large number of different statistics and choose the smallest set that captures (nearly) the same information as the complete set. We then demonstrate that such sets of statistics can be constructed for both parameter estimation and model selection problems, and we apply our approach to a range of illustrative and real-world model selection problems.},

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

The models we design are based on mathematics where there is no room for inconsistencies such that are present in human behaviour. So how do we account for this when we try to model human behaviour in evacuation modelling? Most models provide the possibility to include mathematical distributions and 
algorithms that are supposed to represent this uncertainty that we refer to as behavioural uncertainty. This thesis aims at providing a method based on functional analysis and statistics that can be used to study the effects of behavioural uncertainty on evacuation simulation results and in particular to study convergence in results for important output parameters. Previous work has 
been done for the most important evacuation model output, namely the evacuation time. The work in this thesis contributes by including other output parameters which are of importance both for the evacuation time and other aspects of evacuation safety. The method is accompanied by a tool that helps the user in this kind of quantitative assessment. A demonstration of the method and the tool has been provided through the use of a case study. The results showed that the analysis is efficient in analysing convergence in results for a variety of output parameters, even for output parameters with varying number of data points. This enables a more comprehensive and detailed analysis than what has previously been shown, ensuring that the behaviours that govern evacuation time also have converged in results.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study on pedestrian bidirectional streams and the mechanisms leading to spontaneous lane formation by examining the flow formed by two groups of people walking toward each other in a mock corridor. Flow ratio is changed by changing each group size while maintaining comparable total flow and density. By tracking the trajectories of each pedestrian and analyzing the data obtained, five different phases were recognized as contributing to the transition from unidirectional to bidirectional flow including the spontaneous creation and dissolution of lanes. It has been shown that a statistical treatment is required to understand the fundamental characteristics of pedestrian dynamics and some two-dimensional quantities such as order parameter and rotation range were introduced to allow a more complete analysis. All the quantities observed showed a clear relationship with flow ratio and helped distinguishing between the different characteristic phases of the experiment. Results show that balanced bidirectional flow becomes the most stable configuration after lanes are formed, but the lane creation process requires pedestrians to laterally move to a largest extent compared to low flow-ratio configurations. This finding allows us to understand the reasons why balanced bidirectional flow is efficient at low densities, but quickly leads to deadlock formation at high densities.},

abstract = {A recent field study confirmed that animal crowd behavior is dominated by the interaction from the k-Nearest-Neighbors rather than all the neighbors in a given metric distance. For the reason that systems with local interaction perform similar self-organized phenomena, we in this paper build two models, i.e.,??a metric distance based model and a k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) counterflow model, based on a simple discrete cellular automaton model entitled the basic model, to investigate the fundamental interaction ruling pedestrian counter flow. Pedestrians move in a long channel and as a result are divided into left moving pedestrians and right moving pedestrians. These pedestrians interact with each other in different forms in different models. In the metric distance based model, ones direction of chosen behavior is influenced by all those who are in a small metric distance and come from the opposite direction; while in the kNN counterflow model, ones direction of chosen behavior is influenced by the distribution of a fixed number of the k-Nearest neighbors coming from the opposite direction. The self-organized lane formation is captured and factors affecting the number of lanes formed in the channel are investigated. Results imply that with varying density, the lane formation pattern is almost the same in the kNN counterflow model while it is not in the case of metric distance based model. This means that the kNN interaction plays a more fundamental role in the emergence of collective pedestrian phenomena. Then the kNN counterflow model is further validated by comparing the lane formation pattern and the fundamental diagram with real pedestrian counter flow. Reasons for the lane formation and improvement of flow rate are discussed. The relations among mean velocity, occupancy and total entrance density of the model are also studied. The results indicate that the kNN interaction provides a more efficient traffic condition, and is able to quantify features such as segregation and phase transition at high density of pedestrian traffic.},

abstract = {One of the most important methods for evaluating the characteristics of ad hoc networking protocols is through the use of simulation. Simulation provides researchers with a number of significant benefits, including repeatable scenarios, isolation of parameters, and exploration of a variety of metrics. The topology and movement of the nodes in the simulation are key factors in the performance of the network protocol under study. Once the nodes have been initially distributed, the mobility model dictates the movement of the nodes within the network. Because the mobility of the nodes directly impacts the performance of the protocols, simulation results obtained with unrealistic movement models may not correctly reflect the true performance of the protocols. The majority of existing mobility models for ad hoc networks do not provide realistic movement scenarios; they are limited to random walk models without any obstacles. In this paper, we propose to create more realistic movement models through the incorporation of obstacles. These obstacles are utilized to both restrict node movement as well as wireless transmissions. In addition to the inclusion of obstacles, we construct movement paths using the Voronoi diagram of obstacle vertices. Nodes can then be randomly distributed across the paths, and can use shortest path route computations to destinations at randomly chosen obstacles. Simulation results show that the use of obstacles and pathways has a significant impact on the performance of ad hoc network protocols.},

Since not many MANETs are currently deployed, research in this area is mostly simulation based. Random Waypoint is the commonly used mobility model in these simulations. Random Waypoint is a simple model that may be applicable to some scenarios. However, we believe that it is not sufficient to capture some important mobility characteristics of scenarios in which MANETs may be deployed. Our framework aims to evaluate the impact of different mobility models on the performance of MANET routing protocols. We propose various protocol independent metrics to capture interesting mobility characteristics, including spatial and temporal dependence and geographic restrictions. In addition, a rich set of parameterized mobility models is introduced including Random Waypoint, Group Mobility, Freeway and Manhattan models. Based on these models several ???test-suite??? scenarios are chosen carefully to span the metric space. We demonstrate the utility of our test-suite by evaluating various MANET routing protocols, including DSR, AODV and DSDV. Our results show that the protocol performance may vary drastically across mobility models and performance rankings of protocols may vary with the mobility models used. This effect can be explained by the interaction of the mobility characteristics with the connectivity graph properties. Finally, we attempt to decompose the reactive routing protocols into mechanistic ???building blocks??? to gain a deeper insight into the performance variations across protocols in the face of mobility.},

In this paper, we review the main statistical models proposed in the literature for the estimation of the OD matrix based on traffic counts. Unlike reconstruction models, statistical models do not aim at estimating the exact OD matrix corresponding to observed traffic volumes, but they rather aim at estimating the parameters of a statistical model of the population of OD matrices. Initially we define the estimation problem, emphasizing its underspecified nature, which has lead to the development of several models based on different approaches. We describe static models whose parameters are estimated by means of maximum likelihood, the method of moments, and Bayesian inference. We also describe some recent dynamic models. Following that, we discuss research questions related to the underspecification problem, model assumptions and the estimation of the route choice matrix, and indicate promising research directions.},

  abstract = {The behaviour of many processes in science and engineering can be accurately described by dynamical system models consisting of a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Often these models have several unknown parameters that are difficult to estimate from experimental data, in which case Bayesian inference can be a useful tool. In principle, exact Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques is possible; however, in practice, such methods may suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. To address this problem, several approaches based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have been introduced, including Markov chain Monte Carlo ABC (MCMC ABC) and sequential Monte Carlo ABC (SMC ABC). While the system of ODEs describes the underlying process that generates the data, the observed measurements invariably include errors. In this paper, we argue that several popular ABC approaches fail to adequately model these errors because the acceptance probability depends on the choice of the discrepancy function and the tolerance without any consideration of the error term. We observe that the so-called posterior distributions derived from such methods do not accurately reflect the epistemic uncertainties in parameter values. Moreover, we demonstrate that these methods provide minimal computational advantages over exact Bayesian methods when applied to two ODE epidemiological models with simulated data and one with real data concerning malaria transmission in Afghanistan.},

  abstract = {Summary Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is an approach to sampling from an approximate posterior distribution in the presence of a computationally intractable likelihood function. A common implementation is based on simulating model, parameter and dataset triples from the prior, and then accepting as samples from the approximate posterior, those model and parameter pairs for which the corresponding dataset, or a summary of that dataset, is 'close' to the observed data. Closeness is typically determined though a distance measure and a kernel scale parameter. Appropriate choice of that parameter is important in producing a good quality approximation. This paper proposes diagnostic tools for the choice of the kernel scale parameter based on assessing the coverage property, which asserts that credible intervals have the correct coverage levels in appropriately designed simulation settings. We provide theoretical results on coverage for both model and parameter inference, and adapt these into diagnostics for the ABC context. We re-analyse a study on human demographic history to determine whether the adopted posterior approximation was appropriate. Code implementing the proposed methodology is freely available in the R package abctools.},

  abstract    = {Sensitivity analysis helps decision-makers to understand how a given model output responds when there is variation in the model inputs. One of the most authoritative measures in global sensitivity analysis is the Sobol' total-order index ($T_i$), which can be computed with several different estimators. Although previous comparisons exist, it is hard to know which estimator performs best since the results are contingent on several benchmark settings: the sampling method ($\tau$), the distribution of the model inputs ($\phi$), the number of model runs ($N_t$), the test function or model ($\varepsilon$) and its dimensionality ($k$), the weight of higher order effects (e.g. second, third, $k_2,k_3$), or the performance measure selected ($\delta$). Here we break these limitations and simultaneously assess all total-order estimators in an eight-dimension hypercube where $(\tau, \phi, N_t, \varepsilon, k, k_2, k_3, \delta)$ are treated as random parameters. This design allows to create an unprecedentedly large range of benchmark scenarios. Our results indicate that, in general, the preferred estimator should be Razavi and Gupta's, followed by that of Jansen, or Janon/Monod. The remainder lag significantly behind in performance. Our work helps analysts navigate the myriad of total-order formulae by effectively eliminating the uncertainty in the selection of the best estimator.},

The pedestrian model used for the forecast is a modification of the centrifugal force model which operates in continuous space. It is combined with an event driven route choice algorithm which encompasses the local shortest path, the global shortest path and a combination with the quickest path. A naive implementation of this model has the complexity of O(N2), N being the number of pedestrians. In the first step of the optimisation the complexity is reduced to O(N) using special neighbourhood lists like Verlet-List or Linked-Cell commonly used in molecular dynamics. The next step in this optimisation process is parallelisation on a multicore system. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) application programming interfaces are used to this extend. The simulation is performed on the Juropa cluster installed at the J{\"u}lich Supercomputing Centre. The speedup factors obtained are {\textasciitilde}10 for the linked-cells, {\textasciitilde}4 for 8 threads and {\textasciitilde}3 for the parallelisation on 5 nodes using a static domain decomposition.},

The collaborative Hermes project aims at improving the safety of mass events by constructing an evacuation assistant, a decision support system for heads of operation in an actual evacuation. For this, the status (occupancy and available egress routes) of a facility is constantly monitored with automatic person counters, door sensors, smoke sensors, and manual input from security staff. Starting from this status, egress is simulated faster than real time, and the result visualized in a suitable fashion to show what is likely to happenn in the next 15min. The test case for this evacuation assistant is the clearing of the ESPRIT Arena in D\"usseldorf which holds 50,000-65,000 persons depending on the event type. The on site prediction requires the ability to simulate the egress in $\approx$2min, a task that requires the combination of a fast algorithm and a parallel computer. The paper will describe the details of the evacuation problem, the architecture of the evacuation assistant, the pedestrian motion model employed and the optimization and parallelization of the code.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for estimating pedestrian demand within a train station. It takes into account ridership data, and various direct and indirect indicators of demand. Such indicators may include link flow counts, density measurements, survey data, historical, or other information. The problem is considered in discrete time and at the aggregate level, i.e., for groups of pedestrians associated with the same origin-destination pair and departure time interval. The formulation is probabilistic, allowing to consider the stochasticity of demand. A key element is the use of the train timetable, and in particular of train arrival times, to capture demand peaks. A case study analysis of a Swiss train station underlines the practical applicability of the proposed framework. Compared to a classical estimator that ignores the notion of a train timetable, the gain in accuracy in terms of root-mean-square error is between 20\% and 50\%. More importantly, the incorporation of the train schedule allows for prediction when little or no data besides the timetable and ridership information is available.

This problem is challenging because the number of parameters to be estimated is typically larger than the number of network links.

However, information from the covariance matrix of link count data collected over a sequence of days can relieve this problem of indeterminacy. This fact is illustrated through a simple example. The use of second-order statistical properties of the data in O-D matrix estimation is then explored, and a class of estimators proposed. Practical problems of model mis-specification are discussed and some avenues for future research outlined.},

These matrices are important input for infrastructure management both for pedestrian flow simulations in the planning stage as well as crowd control in the real-time application. Estimation is based on explicit models for the temporal dependence for long-term observations, where the models are adapted from the dynamic freeway OD-matrix estimation approach. Since pedestrian counts currently are subject to non-negligible measurement errors, the estimation uses the generalised method of moments estimation scheme to account for the errors-in-variables problem. Assumptions under which the method produces consistent and asymptotically normal estimators are provided, which are in line with empirically derived characteristics of pedestrian counters. In addition an approximation is provided, which shows superior finite sample properties in return for an asymptotic bias. The suitability of the method is demonstrated using a simulation study as well as a real-world application.},

  abstract = {Visual tracking, in essence, deals with non-stationary image streams that change over time. While most existing algorithms are able to track objects well in controlled environments, they usually fail in the presence of significant variation of the object's appearance or surrounding illumination. One reason for such failures is that many algorithms employ fixed appearance models of the target. Such models are trained using only appearance data available before tracking begins, which in practice limits the range of appearances that are modeled, and ignores the large volume of information (such as shape changes or specific lighting conditions) that becomes available during tracking. In this paper, we present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, efficiently adapting online to changes in the appearance of the target. The model update, based on incremental algorithms for principal component analysis, includes two important features: a method for correctly updating the sample mean, and a forgetting factor to ensure less modeling power is expended fitting older observations. Both of these features contribute measurably to improving overall tracking performance. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large changes in pose, scale, and illumination.},

A computationally efficient algorithm for solving this dynamic linear-programming problem is presented. The algorithm has the following features (a) The only arithmetic operations required are addition and subtraction (b) In solving for a given time period T, optimal solutions for all lesser time periods are a by-product (c) The constructed optimal solution for a given T is presented as a relatively small number of activities (chain-flows) which are repeated over and over until the end of the T periods. Hence, in particular, hold-overs at intermediate nodes are not required (d) Arcs which serve as bottlenecks for the flow are singled out, as well as the time periods in which they act as such (e) In solving the problem for successive values of T, stabilization on a set of chain-flows (see (c) above) eventually occurs, and an a priori bound on when stabilization occurs can be established. The fact that there exist solutions to this problem which have the simple form described in (c) is remarkable, since other dynamic linear-programming problems that have been studied do not enjoy this property.},

Later, and even up to the present, they were conceived as distinct channels by which messages were sent to the brain. Each has an obvious and seemingly isolated organ. The simplicity of this scheme began to break up in the nineteenth century. The list of senses had to be extended. Kinaesthesis was added, but it had to include the sense of position of the body as well as of movement. The equilibrium sense was discovered, its organs being part of the inner ``ear'' or labyrinth. Temperature and pain were added, or else made subdivisions of the skin sense. Touch itself proved to be complex. The senses were classified by Sherrington as exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive, but these classes do not now appear to be mutually exclusive.},

  abstract = {Large scale renovation of rail stations to cater for growing passenger demand has been taking place in various sites in Japan. These projects pose a challenge to researchers to identify suitable technical methods to develop infrastructure layouts that efficiently cater for movement of walking passengers. This paper presents an application in relation to the JR Takatsuki station where there was a narrow island platform catering for large volume of boarding, alighting and transferring passengers. In 2015, the operator has begun expanding the station to alleviate the platform congestion. The objective of the project is to develop a method of forecasting pedestrian flow patterns within a railway station for a proposed new layout of platforms and interconnecting links. The methodology will be demonstrated using Takatsuki station as a case study. The core of the methodology utilizes pedestrian origin-destination pattern to estimate measures of walking effort of pedestrians. In addition to the analytical modelling technique an application of a simulation model is also described. The simulation method is helpful as it is able to provide a visual appreciation of the future operation of the railway concourses. Results indicate that the congestion on the current platform will be alleviated. However, connecting passages to the new platform can become congested because of flow conflicts among transferring passengers and those boarding and alighting.},

The dynamic assignment framework is based on a schedule-based transit network model, which can help determine the time-dependent least cost paths between all O-D pairs, and for each of them the clock arrival times at the end nodes of all observed links (if any) in the transit network. An entropy-based approach is then employed to estimate the time-dependent O-D matrices based on the observed passenger counts at those observed links in the network. An efficient sparse algorithm is also proposed to solve the resulting mathematical programming problem. The estimation methodology is tested in a transit network from the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system in Hong Kong which is one of the busiest railway systems in the world. Both cases with and without prior information of the O-D matrices are considered for this network. The predicted matrices are then compared with the true matrices obtained from a sophisticated electronic fare collection system of MTR. Good agreement between predicted and observed matrices are found.},

It is suggested that the move from behaviorism to cognitivism is best represented in terms of the replacement of (operationally defined) ``intervening variables'' by genuine ``hypothetical constructs'' possessing cognitive ``surplus meaning,'' and that the ``cognitive revolution'' of the 1950s continued a cognitive tradition that can be traced back to the 1920s.},

Serial processing allows only one object at a time to be processed, whereas parallel processing assumes that various objects are processed simultaneously. Here, we present novel neural models for the two types of processing mechanisms based on analysis of simultaneously recorded spike trains using electrophysiological data from prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys while processing task-relevant visual displays. We combine mathematical models describing neuronal attention and point process models for spike trains. The same model can explain both serial and parallel processing by adopting different parameter regimes. We present statistical methods to distinguish between serial and parallel processing based on both maximum likelihood estimates and decoding the momentary focus of attention when two stimuli are presented simultaneously. Results show that both processing mechanisms are in play for the simultaneously recorded neurons, but neurons tend to follow parallel processing in the beginning after the onset of the stimulus pair, whereas they tend to serial processing later on.},

Are they right to do so? Innateness is often defined by appealing to the role of genes in development, to the role of Darwinian evolution in shaping developmental processes, to the non-involvement of learning during development, to developmental robustness, and to modularity. We argue that all such definitions are unsatisfactory. Some are unsatisfactory because they are based on simplistic and empirically outmoded views of development. Others are empirically defensible but are unsatisfactory because they do not capture the full breadth of the use of the term ???innate??? and, due to this restriction, they can easily lead to inferential mistakes. The definition of acquired behavior has been used with greater sophistication and is generally regarded as being heterogeneous. Nevertheless, in as much as the overall category has been seen in opposition to the innate, it has been an obstacle to a thorough investigation of how behavior develops. We suggest that a useful way forward is to examine whether or not the empirically well-established properties often associated with the concept of innate and the concept of acquired form theoretically useful clusters. This path leads to a much fuller appreciation of the view favored by Gilbert Gottlieb, according to which development involves the continuous interplay of the organism (and its genes) with its environment.},

  abstract = {Fire regulations for buildings and architectural designs aimed at providing escape routes in case of fire, rest on unexamined assumptions. These are, briefly, that people 'panic' in fire and smoke and are therefore best kept in ignorance until the danger has been established that providing a variety of escape routes for use only in emergency will avert the surge to one entrance and the fight to escape through it. For shorthand this is called the panic concept or scenario. Evidence of real behaviour in fires does not support it. As will be shown, people appear to behave rationally in the light of the information they have. They also show marked preference for familiar routes and exits and concern for the safety of their family members. This is called the 'affiliation' model. Chapter 1 outlines the aims and structure of the thesis. Chapter 2 discusses the concept of panic and affiliative model. Chapter 3 reviews the existing research on escape behaviour in fires. Chapter 4 outlines the research strategy adopted: based on multivariate statistical analyses of categorical (frequency) data derived from interview accounts collected from fire survivors: Act sequence transitions, Multi-variate and Partial-Order Scalogram Analyses (MSA-1, POSA), Causal Loglinear Analysis (CLA). The analyses focus on Recognition of the fire threat, Role, Location, Group membership and Location, Direction of Movement. Chapter. 5 analyses the sequence of acts of 41 individuals in 14 domestic fires. Chapter 6 analyses the pattern and distance moved by 33 survivors of an hotel fire. Chapter 7 examines the exit choice behaviour by 75 people in the Marquee Showbar (MSB) (Summer-land Fire). Chapter 8 examines the pattern of affiliative behaviour of 128 people in the Solarium (Summerland). Chapter 9 analyses the outcome of escape behaviour for groups and individuals in the MSB and Solarium. In general, the affiliative model fits the results much more closely than the panic concept. Chapter 10 outlines the implications of the research, in particular the weakness in assuming people will use conventionally unfamiliar emergency escape routes.},

nonlinear models. This is based on a measure of importance to calculate the
fractional contribution of the input parameters to the variance of the model
prediction. Measures of importance in sensitivity analysis have been suggested
by several authors, whose work is reviewed in this article. More emphasis is
given to the developments of sensitivity indices by the Russian mathematician
I.M. Sobol'. Given that Sobol' treatment of the measure of importance is the
most general, his formalism is employed throughout this paper where
conceptual and computational improvements of the method are presented.
The computational novelty of this study is the introduction of the 'total effect'
parameter index. This index provides a measure of the total effect of a given
parameter, including all the possible synergetic terms between that parameter
and all the others. Rank transformation of the data is also introduced in order
to increase the reproducibility of the method. These methods are tested on a
few analytical and computer models. The main conclusion of this work is the
identification of a sensitivity analysis methodology which is both flexible,
accurate and informative, and which can be achieved at reasonable computational
cost.},

abstract = {The semi-variogram is central to geostatistics and the single most important tool in geo-statistical applications to soil. Mathematical functions for semi-variograms must be conditional negative semi-definite, and there are only a few families of simple function that meet this demand. These include the transitive models with finite a priori variance deriving from moving average processes. The spherical and exponential schemes are the most often encountered members. The other major group is that of unbounded models in which the variance appears to increase without limit. The linear model is the most common in this group. If more complex models are needed they can be formed by combining two or more simple models. The usual estimator of the semi-variance is often considered inefficient and to be sensitive to departures from normality in the data. It is compared with a robust estimator and shown to be generally preferable in being unbiased and having confidence intervals that are no wider. For routine analysis, fitting models to sample semi-variograms by weighted least squares approximation, with weights proportional to the expected semi-variance, is preferred to the more elaborate and computationally demanding statistical procedures of generalized least squares and maximum likelihood. The Akaike information criterion is recommended for selecting the best model from several plausible ones to describe the observed variation in soil, though for kriging it may be desirable to validate the chosen model. Examples of models fitted to soil semi-variograms are shown and compared.},

  abstract    = {This chapter suggests that the sociologist should examine his problem from as many different methodological perspectives as possible. Many sociologists assume that their research methods are neutral "atheoretical tools" suitable for valid scientific use by any knowledgeable user. Despite the existence of public rules governing the enterprise called science, the values, definitions and ideologies of each scientist significantly determine the translation of rules of method into the scientific process. Triangulation, or the use of multiple methods, is a plan of action that will raise sociologists above the personalistic biases that stem from single methodologies. The chapter focuses on the inherent difficulties of generating valid sociological data. It also suggests that the resolutions to this difficulty are two-fold. First, sociologists must realize that their growth as a science is contingent on the recognition of these elements. Second, multiple strategies of triangulation are proposed as the preferred line of action.},

investigates the properties of crowd motion with external rhythms. With rhythm, pedestrians stop more

flow with rhythms are lower than that without any rhythm at high densities due to the more frequent stopping.
Stepping behavior analysis shows that the step frequency with rhythms is smaller than that without any rhythm,
especially at high densities. Dynamic coordinated behavior is weakened by music, which also affectsthe stepping
behavior. Our study will be helpful for understanding the effect of background music on pedestrian movement.},

Several studies on Emergency Management exist in literature, but the majority of them do not consider how human behavior impacts the evacuation plan. Indeed, these can change drastically a critical scenario because are driven by emotions, knowledge and perception which are unpredictable. The aim of this study is to develop an ABM of an evacuation scenario due to a blast in a public area integrated with a mathematical dynamic human behavior model. Netlogo, which is a multi-agent programmable environment, was used to build the ABM. ABMs simulate two phases: the normal phase and the agent's evacuation process after the blast. The evacuation time is the main parameter of response and it is used to evaluate the efficiency and safety of an infrastructure. Each agent has its own behavior according to a layered framework mathematical model. The first layer, thanks to an empirical statistical distribution, simulates the "agent's state" function of the role performed by the agent and his age. Then the "individual module" describes the emotional aspects using the Decision Field Theory. This ABM becomes an important tool that enables designers or policy makers to test, estimating and improving the response of infrastructures in hazardous scenario.},

  title       = {A New Generic Approach to the Pedestrian Fundamental Diagram},
  doi         = {10.3929/ethz-b-000296226},
  abstract    = {The pedestrian fundamental diagram, which describes the relationship between speed, flow and density, is one of the key concepts for the design of pedestrian facilities. It allows to determine the capacity of facilities as well as to calculate estimated walking times, for example when changing trains. In the last decades, laboratory and field measurements have been conducted to obtain the fundamental diagram for different situations. Based on this it was revealed that the fundamental diagram differs significantly between different locations and pedestrian compositions. Various parameters  which significantly influence the shape of the fundamental diagram curve have been determined. Thus, poor results might occur when using a general form of the fundamental diagram for design purpose. Still, only either fundamental diagrams measured in a single setting or ones aggregating these measurements are available. No comprehensive model was found which is able to describe the differences observed as well as being able to estimate fundamental diagrams for other pedestrian compositions. Currently, an estimation of a specific fundamental diagram without corresponding empirical data is not possible.

The idea of this thesis is to address this research gap by creating a generic model, which describes the main walking principles and the interaction between pedestrians. Using this model allows to generate situation specific fundamental diagrams. In addition, the underlying principles which determine the shape of the fundamental diagram are determined and the effect of different influence factors on human walking can be studied. By applying situation specific input parameter values, it shall be possible to generate situation specific fundamental diagrams useful for the design of pedestrian facilities.

The model creation was done in two steps. As a basis for the quantitative fundamental diagram model, a qualitative generic walking model was developed. A comprehensive overview of the basic principles of walking and the interaction of pedestrian was given in the generic walking model. This was done by combining individual findings available in literature. Starting from a simple case, where a pedestrian is walking alone at constant speed, the model is extended to include all relevant influences on a pedestrian.

The generic pedestrian walking model was then used as a basis for the fundamental diagram model. Here, a microscopic model was established where also the distribution of input parameter values can be simulated. Again, first a simple model was set up and complexity was added step by step. In the end a model was created based on lane movement of pedestrians, where lane swapping is possible to enable overtaking.

For the model setup, a thoroughly literature review was performed at the beginning of this work. A special focus was laid on the pedestrian walking speed. The different influences on the free flow walking speed were collected and their effect was estimated. In addition, a definition of the fundamental diagram useful for this work and a detailed discussion on the time aspect of the Level of Service concept, which is closely linked to the fundamental diagram, was made in connection to the literature review.

For the calibration and validation of the model, empirical data already available from experiments and real-life measurements was used. This allowed to cover a wide range of different setting in the validation. In conclusion, the validation showed that the model is expected to provide adequately accurate and useful results for the expected scope of application.

Using the model it was possible to accept the research question stating that it is possible to create a generic pedestrian fundamental diagram model. This can be used to estimate specific fundamental diagrams. However, it was found that although the model is based strongly on the basic principles of walking, the estimation of the input parameters can be challenging. Still, for experienced users it is expected that the model will provide better results than general fundamental diagrams currently used.

The validated model is ready to be used to estimate situation specific fundamental diagrams. This was done for different scenarios, for example for the expected situation in 2050 or to determine the effect of the mixture of commuters and shoppers on the pedestrian flow. In the future scenario it was shown that the assumed trends result in reduced walking speeds, especially at higher densities. Here, the model allows for the first time to evaluate the effect of different changes and the simulation of fundamental diagrams for situations, where no empirical data is available.},

  abstract  = {Since about 80 years, human walking speed has been measured for different purposes. The comparability of the results of these measurements is low, as the walking speed is influenced by a vast amount of parameters and no standardised measurement conditions exist. This work describes the most important factors influencing walking speed based on existing literature and estimates their impact. For this purpose, all walking speed measurements available in the literature were collected and reviewed. Using this data, the parameter values for different influences were computed and grouped according to their strength, which enables to determine the most important measurement parameters in future walking speed experiments. In addition, standardised measurement conditions are proposed which would provide a baseline for future studies and thus enhance their scientific value. For each of these conditions average walking speeds are calculated and the significance of the walking speed differences was determined.},
