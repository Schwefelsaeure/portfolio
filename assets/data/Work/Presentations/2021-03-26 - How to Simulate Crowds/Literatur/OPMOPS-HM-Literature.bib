  abstract  = {Pedestrian dynamics is an interdisciplinary field of research. Psychologists, sociologists, traffic engineers, physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists all strive to understand the dynamics of a moving crowd. 
In principle, computer simulations offer means to further this understanding. Yet, unlike for many classic dynamical systems in physics, there is no universally accepted locomotion model for crowd dynamics. On the contrary, a multitude 
of approaches, with very different characteristics, compete. Often only the experts in one special model type are able to assess the consequences these characteristics have on a simulation study. Therefore, scientists from all disciplines who 
wish to use simulations to analyze pedestrian dynamics need a tool to compare competing approaches. Developers, too, would profit from an easy way to get insight into an alternative modeling ansatz. Vadere meets this interdisciplinary demand 
by offering an open-source simulation framework that is lightweight in its approach and in its user interface while offering pre-implemented versions of the most widely spread models.},

  abstract  = {Crowd simulations depend on empirical evidence as basis for 
model development. However, for many scenarios with high practical impact such evidence is still scarce. There are compelling reasons for this: Experiments involving human participants are expensive, labor intensive, and they carry a high risk for bias. This applies to both sides, experimenter and participants. In this contribution we present two experiment setups to observe pedestrian motion through high and low densities.  We focus on the measures we take to avoid observer bias, undue influence on the participants and learning effects. In the first experiment, a waiting crowd of 13 participants is passed by a walking proband. In the second experiment, a waiting dyad is passed by a walking proband. Our experiment designs ensure that we can provide the scientific community with reliable data on a crowd phenomenon where evidence is still missing: single pedestrians maneuvering through a crowd.},

  abstract  = {Simulation models of pedestrian dynamics have become an invaluable tool for evacuation planning. Typically crowds are assumed to stream unidirectionally towards a safe area. Simulated agents avoid collisions through mechanisms that belong to each individual, such as being repelled from each other by imaginary forces. But classic locomotion models fail when collective cooperation is called for, notably when an agent, say a first-aid attendant, needs to forge a path through a densely packed group. We present a controlled experiment to observe what happens when humans pass through a dense static crowd. We formulate and test hypothesis on salient phenomena. We discuss our observations in a psychological framework. We derive a model that incorporates: agents' perception and cognitive processing of a situation that needs cooperation; selection from a portfolio of behaviours, such as being cooperative; and a suitable action, such as swapping places. Agents' ability to successfully get through a dense crowd emerges as an effect of the psychological model.},

  abstract  = {Microscopic crowd simulations have become an essential tool
to devise safety strategies within built environments. Evacuating a building
means guiding pedestrians trough a series of corridors and doors, that
is, a series of bottlenecks. Thus, bottlenecks are of particular importance
in simulation studies. Simulation models depend on a number of parameters
whose exact values are often unknown. Prominent examples are the
number of pedestrians or their free-ow speeds. We carry out sensitivity
studies to analyze the system behaviour when crucial model parameters
are varied. We compute Sobol' indices using polynomial chaos expansion
to identify parameters with a strong impact on important evacuation
quantities such as the density in front of the bottleneck. A further di-
culty in this process arises from the fact that many simulation models,
including the one we use, are not strictly deterministic. In this paper,
we propose a pragmatic approach to deal with this stochasticity of the
simulation model.},

  abstract   = {Microscopic crowd simulation can help to enhance the safety of pedestrians in situations that range from museum visits to music festivals. To obtain a useful prediction, the input parameters must be chosen carefully. In many cases, a lack of knowledge or limited measurement accuracy add uncertainty to the input. In addition, for meaningful parameter studies, we first need to identify the most influential parameters of our parametric computer models. The field of uncertainty quantification offers standardized and fully automatized methods that we believe to be beneficial for pedestrian dynamics. In addition, many methods come at a comparatively low cost, even for computationally expensive problems. This allows for their application to larger scenarios. We aim to identify and adapt fitting methods to microscopic crowd simulation in order to explore their potential in pedestrian dynamics. In this work, we first perform a variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices and then crosscheck the results by a derivative-based measure, the activity scores. We apply both methods to a typical scenario in crowd simulation, a bottleneck. Because constrictions can lead to high crowd densities and delays in evacuations, several experiments and simulation studies have been conducted for this setting. We show qualitative agreement between the results of both methods. Additionally, we identify a one-dimensional subspace in the input parameter space and discuss its impact on the simulation. Moreover, we analyze and interpret the sensitivity indices with respect to the bottleneck scenario.},

  abstract  = {Protest demonstrations are a manifestation of fundamental rights. Authorities are responsible for guiding protesters safely along predefined routes, typically set in an urban built environment. Microscopic crowd simulations support decision-makers in finding sustainable crowd management strategies. Planning routes usually requires knowledge about the length of the demonstration march. This case study quantifies the impact of two uncertain parameters, the number of protesters and the standard deviation of their free-flow speeds, on the length of a protest march through Kaiserslautern, Germany. Over 1000 participants walking through more than 100 000m2 lead to a computationally demanding model that cannot be analyzed with a standard Monte Carlo ansatz. We select and apply analysis methods that are efficient for large topographies. This combination constitutes the main novelty of this paper: We compute Sobol??? indices with two different methods, based on polynomial chaos expansions, for a down-scaled version of the original set-up and compare them to Monte Carlo computations. We employ the more accurate of the approaches for the full-scale scenario. The simulation results show a shift in the governing parameter over time stressing the benefits of a time-dependent analysis. We discuss typical actions and their effectiveness in view of the findings.},
