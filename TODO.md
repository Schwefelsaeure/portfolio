# TODO

- Create deploy pipeline as described here: https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/making-github-pages-work-with-latest-jekyll/
- Check why Chromium under Linux does not apply the correct "padding" settings for "a" tags and "dropdown" class in "nav" node. Both elements use different "padding" settings.
