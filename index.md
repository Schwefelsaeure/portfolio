# Intro

Hi, I am Benedikt and I studied computer science.

Use this site to learn more about me, my hobbies and some of my software projects.

# Learning is the fun part of life

There is one aspect which is very central in my life: The joy of learning new things and to explore the unkown.

For instance, thatâ€™s also why I have been learning to play the piano autodidactically. Thank you very, very much to [kpharloff](https://www.youtube.com/c/kevinpharloff/) who inspired me with [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSE4iwR-cuY) to start learning the piano.

I attend online courses on learning platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) to deepen my computer science knowledge. For instance, this includes courses about [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala), [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) or [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170). The aforementioned sites are great platforms to broaden your horizon --- and many courses are freely available. :)

I employ  this new knowledge to implement simple software projects in my spare time. For example, I implemented a simple [browser-based video chat client](https://github.com/Schwefelsaeure/Programming/tree/main/Projects/JavaScript/JavaScript-Videochat) like "Zoom" (thanks [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) for your inspiration). This project and other hobby projects can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/Schwefelsaeure).
